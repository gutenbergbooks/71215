</div>

<p>I often run down to Badgertown and into the
little brown house to talk things over with the
Peppers, and every single time they one and
all tell me they don’t think I have told enough
about David.</p>

<p>It quite cut me to the heart the other day to
hear Polly say mournfully, “You’ve made a
book about Ben and one about Phronsie, and
you’ve told all about Joel’s Adventures, and
stories that I made up; and you never let Davie
have a book—and he is <i>our Davie</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will, Polly—I will!” I promised.
And she laughed gleefully, and Ben smiled in
great satisfaction, and Joel said: “Whickets!
Now, Dave, you’re going to have a book all to
yourself.” And Phronsie crowed and gurgled,
and made a cheese right in the middle of the old
kitchen floor. As for Mother Pepper, the
look she gave me, well—wasn’t I glad that
I had promised!</p>

<p>But David ran up to me and whispered, “I’d
rather you made another book about Joel.”</p>

<p>“I can’t, Davie,” I whispered back, “the
children all over the country have been teasing
me for years to give them a book about you.
And now as all the rest of the Pepper family
want it, why, you see, I just <i>must</i> write it.”</p>

<p>“O dear!” said David.</p>

<p>Polly ran over to our corner. “Dear Margaret
Sidney,” she begged, clasping her hands,
“<i>please</i> tell all about Davie when he was a
little boy. That’s what we want; because you
see you told ever so much more about the rest
of us than you did about him. And Davie
was always just splendid! Why, he was our
Davie!”</p>

<p>So now here is “Our Davie Pepper,” just as
the Little Brown House people wanted me to
write it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>DAVIE AND OLD MAN PETERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“MY sakes! David Pepper, you can’t get
it in.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can, Mrs. Peters.”</p>

<p>“No, you can’t. There, give it to me.
You’re all het up, runnin’ on arrants for Mr.
Atkins. He shouldn’t ’a’ told you to hurry
clear down here from th’ store.”</p>

<p>David sank down on the wooden box turned
upside down outside the Peters kitchen door,
and watched Mrs. Peters’s vigorous efforts to
crowd a long woolen coat, very much frayed
on the edge, one sleeve gone, and various other
dilapidations that might be noticed, into a
round, splint-bottomed basket. “Your ma c’n
do th’ mendin’ better’n me,” she said, during
the process, and dropping her voice as her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
roved anxiously. “I put th’ pieces underneath.
O my!” she whirled around suddenly,
her back to the basket, and brought up a red
face. “How you scar’t me, Tildy!” as the
kitchen door was flung wide and a head thrust
out.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t Pa—you needn’t be afraid.” Yet
Tildy looked over her shoulder and grasped her
apron tighter over something huddled up within
its folds, as she skipped over the big flat stone.
“You know as well as I do that he’s well off
toward the south medder.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t nothin’ to be certain sure of, if your
pa is headed for th’ south medder, that he
won’t see what we’re doin’ here,” said her
mother hopelessly. “Well, what you got in
your apron?”</p>

<p>Matilda knelt down by the basket on the
grass, and flung her apron wide. “It’s some o’
my quince sass.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t goin’ to give that away!” cried
Mrs. Peters in alarm, and resting both hands
on her knees. “Gracious, your pa—”</p>

<p>“Let Pa alone, can’t you?” cried Matilda
lifting the coat-edge to tuck in the big glass
jar. “I guess he won’t rage an’ ramp no more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
at th’ sass, than your lettin’ Mis Pepper mend
this coat.”</p>

<p>“Well, I d’no. Sass is sass, an’ your pa
knows how many jars you put up—O dear me,
Matilda!” She gazed helplessly off toward
the south meadow.</p>

<p>Davie got off from the wooden box. “Oh
don’t, Mrs. Peters,” he begged in great distress,
“send the jelly to Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t jell—it’s sass,” said Matilda, pushing
the jar in further, and flapping the coat
till it bulged over the basket. “An’ I guess
I ain’t goin’ to let your ma have all them
measles to your house, an’ not do nothin’.
There—” She jumped to her feet. “You
got to carry it careful, Davie. It’s too bad
there ain’t no handle.” She twitched the
frayed cord that served as one, “I’ll get another
string.”</p>

<p>“Come back here, Tilly,” cried her mother.
“Ain’t you crazy! Your pa’ll be back. Let
Davie go.”</p>

<p>Matilda turned away from the kitchen door.
“Ain’t you silly, Ma!” yet she came back.
“Well there, run along, Davie, an’ carry it
careful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“An’ you tell your ma,” said Mrs. Peters,
“we’re sorry she’s got all the measles to her
house, an’ she c’n mend my coat better’n me,
an’ she mustn’t tell no one it’s for Mis Peters,
an’—”</p>

<p>“Land, Ma, th’ boy can’t remember all that,”
said Matilda, giving David a little push.</p>

<p>“I guess I can—I’ll try to,” said David,
grasping the old worn string with both hands.</p>

<p>“You go along,” said Matilda, with another
push, “an’ if you see Pa comin’ along anywhere,
you set th’ basket in behind th’ bushes
till he gits by. Remember, David Pepper!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said David. “I’ll remember.”</p>

<p>“Well, now come along, Ma Peters,” said
Matilda; “he hain’t spilled th’ things yit, an’
he’s turned th’ road. We’ve got to git back
to work.”</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t be so bad ef you hadn’t put in
that quince sass, Tildy,” mourned her mother,
picking up her worn calico gown to step over
a puddle of water from a broken drain-pipe.
“But I’m awful skeered about that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ma, you make me sick.” Matilda gave
her a little push into the kitchen, slipped in
after her, and slammed the door; but her hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
shook as she took up the broom. “I’m goin’
to work anyhow. You c’n set an’ worry about
Pa, ef you want to. <i>I’m</i> glad for my part, that
Mis Pepper’s goin’ to have that basket o’
things.”</p>

<p>“So be I,” cried Mrs. Peters. “Land
sakes! I guess I’m as glad as you be, Tildy
Peters. An’ I s’pose Davie’s gittin’ along towards
home pretty fast by this time.”</p>

<p>Matilda shook her head and pursed up her
lips as she went out to sweep the back entry.
“All the same, I wish Davie Pepper was safe
home to the little brown house,” she said to
herself.</p>

<p>The old cord cut into Davie’s fingers as he
trudged along the winding road, the basket
wobbling about from side to side; but every
step was bringing him home to Mamsie, and
he smiled as he went along.</p>

<p>“Hey there!” a sudden turn of the road
brought him squarely before a tall gaunt old
man leaning against the stone wall on the other
side of a scrub oak.</p>

<p>“Where you ben?” demanded Old Man
Peters.</p>

<p>“Just—just—” began David.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“Jest where? Stop your hemmin’ an’
hawin’. Where you ben?”</p>

<p>Davie clutched the basket with trembling
fingers and a wild despair that it was now too
late to consider bushes.</p>

<p>“You ben down to my house, I know.” Old
Man Peters’s little eyes gleamed fiercely.
“Well, what you got in that basket?” pointing
to it.</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s—”</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s— Didn’t I tell you to stop
hemmin’ an’ hawin’, you Pepper Boy! I’ll give
you somethin’ to hem an’ haw for pretty soon,
ef you don’t look out.” He broke off a stick
from the scrub oak.</p>

<p>Davie clutched the old string tighter yet.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” said Old Man Peters, drawing
close to poke up a corner of the coat with the
stick.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t,” said Davie, drawing back,
and putting one hand over the top of the
basket.</p>

<p>“Mustn’t,” roared Old Man Peters, shaking
the stick at him.</p>

<p>“No,” said Davie. “You mustn’t,” and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
tried to edge off farther; but the stick came
down across his little calico blouse.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you somethin’ to make you see
that you can’t say ‘mustn’t’ to me,” said Mr.
Peters, bringing the stick down again.
“There, you take that!”</p>

<p>Davie was whirling around now so fast that
Old Man Peters preferred to try the stick on
the little legs instead of the small shoulders in
the calico blouse, while he roared, “I’ll make
you dance. Drop that basket, will you!”</p>

<p>“Here—what you doin’?” somebody
called out, and a young man leaped the stone
wall. “Hulloa, old Peters, you stop that!”</p>

<p>Old Man Peters turned around. He would
have dropped the stick, but the young man
saved him the trouble by seizing it to break it
into two pieces and toss them into the dusty
road.</p>

<p>“He’s ben a-sassin’ me,” cried the old man,
pointing to David, who had sunk down on the
grass by the side of the road, still hanging to
the basket.</p>

<p>“Well, you ain’t a-goin’ to beat up any boy
in Badgertown. Now I tell you, Peters! And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
who wouldn’t sass you, I wonder. Here you,
get up,” he said, going over to David.</p>

<p>But David showing no inclination to get up,
the man turned his face over.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be blowed, ef tain’t one o’ th’
Pepper children,” he exclaimed, starting back.
“You’ve got to take somethin’ from me, now
I tell you, Old Man Peters!” He pushed up
his gray cotton shirt-sleeves and advanced on
the old man, “for beatin’ up one o’ Mis Pepper’s
boys.”</p>

<p>“You git away—tain’t nothin’ to you, Jim
Thompson,” cried Mr. Peters, “an’ I’ll have th’
law on you, ef you tetch me!” He put up both
horny hands and tried to huddle back of the
scrub oak.</p>

<p>“Th’ law’s got to deal with you, Old Peters,
first, an’ it’ll fall pretty heavy for hurtin’ one
o’ them Pepper children,” declared Thompson,
dragging him by an angry hand back to the
road side.</p>

<p>“David—David Pepper!” screamed the old
farmer, “you tell him. I ’ain’t hurt ye. Tell
him, David. Ow! you let me be, Jim Thompson!”</p>

<p>David looked up and tried to speak. Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
if Mamsie were only here! Then his head fell
down on the dusty road.</p>

<p>“Look at that boy, you old scoundrel!”
roared Thompson, cuffing Old Man Peters
wherever he got a good chance. Then he flung
him to the middle of the road. “Lie there till
I can ’tend to you.” But the old farmer preferred
to attend to himself, and without waiting
to pick up his hat that had fallen off in the
scuffle, he slunk off as fast as he conveniently
could.</p>

<p>“Don’t hurt him,” begged Davie feebly, as
Thompson bent over him. “Oh, I want
Mamsie!”</p>

<p>“You’re a-goin’ to her—I’ll take you.”
The young man lifted him up to his shoulder,
Davie still clinging to the basket. “Where did
he hurt you?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m not hurt much,” said Davie, trying not
to cry.</p>

<p>Jim Thompson set his teeth hard. “Here,
give me that basket,” and holding Davie fast by
one arm, he strode off, first kicking Old Man
Peters’s hat into a neighboring field where it
landed in a bog.</p>

<p>“Mamsie—somebody’s coming, and he’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
got a big bundle—how funny,” cried Polly,
looking out of the window.</p>

<p>“A pedlar, most likely,” said Mrs. Pepper,
over in the window, trying to finish a coat to go
back to Mr. Atkins at the store. The measles
were making it extra hard to keep the wolf
from the door.</p>

<p>“Well, he won’t sell anything here,” said
Polly with a laugh, and running to the old green
door. “Why—” as she flung it open.</p>

<p>It was all over in a minute, and Mrs. Pepper
had her boy in her arms. Davie trying to
say, “I’m not much hurt,” and Polly running
for the camphor bottle, while Jim Thompson
set down the basket on the floor, where it rolled
over and out flew the “quince sass” from the
protecting folds of the coat.</p>

<p>“Old Man Peters was a-beatin’ him up,”
said the young farmer, working his hands awkwardly
together and wishing he could help.</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” said Davie, both hands around
her neck, and cuddling up to lay his white cheek
against her face, “I didn’t let him have the
basket—and you are to mend the coat. You
can do it so much better, she says, than she
can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“Mrs. Peters, Davie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Miss Matilda sent the jelly—no,
it isn’t jelly—but—I forget—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, dear. Now let Mother see
where you are hurt.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamsie!” Polly, flying back with the
camphor bottle, was aghast as Mrs. Pepper
stripped off the calico blouse.</p>

<p>“Put down the camphor, Polly,” said Mother
Pepper. Her lips were set very tightly together,
and a bright spot burned on either
cheek. “Bring Mother the oil bottle and get
the roll of old cotton in the lower bureau
drawer. Be careful not to wake up Phronsie.
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, for bringing home
my boy,” as Polly ran off.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll go back an’ lick Old Man
Peters,” said the young farmer, turning off to
the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Mother Pepper spoke quickly.
“Say nothing to him. I’ll take care of the
matter.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to,” said Mr. Thompson longingly.</p>

<p>“No—No—” Mrs. Pepper shook her
head decidedly. And he went off.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamsie, that wicked Old Man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Peters!” Polly clasped her hands, and her
brown eyes blazed. “I just want something
dreadful to happen to him,” and she hovered
over David bolstered up in Mamsie’s rocking
chair, his legs and little shoulders bound up in
old cotton bandages.</p>

<p>“Polly,” said Mother Pepper sternly, “never
let me hear you say anything like that again.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” said Polly, fighting with
the tears. Then she gave it up and ran over
to throw herself down on the floor and lay her
head in Mother Pepper’s lap, “to think of
Davie being hurt. Oh, Mamsie!”</p>

<p>“I’m not <i>much</i> hurt,” said Davie, poking up
his head from the pillow against his back,
“only my legs—they’re a little bad. Don’t
cry, Polly,” he begged, dreadfully distressed.</p>

<p>“Our Davie!” sobbed Polly, huddling down
further in her mother’s lap, “just think, Mamsie,—<i>our
Davie</i>!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper shut her lips together, but she
smoothed Polly’s brown head. “Mother will
see to it,” she said, “and you must never say
anything like that again, Polly. Now wipe
your eyes; here comes Dr. Fisher.”</p>

<p>“Well—well—well—” cried the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Doctor, coming in cheerily. He was very
happy as Ben was getting along splendidly,
while as for Phronsie, why she just got better
and better every day. Oh, the measles wasn’t
so very bad after all to fight. But now, here
was Davie bolstered up in the big calico-covered
chair. O dear, that was too bad!</p>

<p>“Well, my boy,” the little Doctor got over
to the chair and looked down at him with keen
eyes behind the big spectacles, “what’s the matter
with you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not much hurt,” said Davie, “only my
legs—they feel the worst.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Dr. Fisher. Then he set down
his bag and looked over at Mrs. Pepper. So
then the story had to come out. When it was
all told and Dr. Fisher became quiet, for he was
almost as bad as Polly in his indignation, and
Davie’s legs and shoulders had been taken care
of, “You don’t need to do anything, Mrs. Pepper,”
he said, “I’ll take care of that brute of a
man.”</p>

<p>And Mother Pepper said just as she had told
the young farmer, “Oh, no, I will see to the
matter myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody—I got the wood all piled at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Deacon Blodgett’s.” In rushed Joel. “Come
on, Dave,” and he was scurrying over to Mamsie’s
big chair, when he spied the basket on the
floor, for nobody had thought or cared about it.
And there was the jar of Matilda’s “quince
sass” that had rolled off by itself. “Oh,” he
pounced upon it, “may I have some—may I?”
He ran with it to Mrs. Pepper, nearly upsetting
the little Doctor on the way.</p>

<p>“Look out there,” cried Doctor Fisher;
“here, don’t run me down, Joe,” and then Joel
saw Davie propped against the pillows. Down
went Matilda’s “quince sass” on the kitchen
floor, and he threw himself into the chair on
top of Davie, poor bandaged legs and all.</p>

<p>The little old kitchen then was in a hubbub.
It all had to be explained to Joel, who made
things so very dreadful that finally Doctor
Fisher said, “I’ll take him off, Mrs. Pepper.
Hold on to that boy, Polly, till I’ve had a look
at Ben up in the loft. If Phronsie is asleep,
she’s all right. Then, Joel Pepper, you shall
hop into my gig.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>MRS. PEPPER ATTENDS TO THE
MATTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PARSON HENDERSON shut the gate
with a firm hand, and stepped out into the
road.</p>

<p>The parsonage door opened, and the minister’s
wife ran down the path. “Here, Adoniram,
take this to Mrs. Pepper.” She put a
clean folded napkin, from which came a nice
smell of something newly baked, into his hand.
“Oh, I do hope Mrs. Pepper will let you see
that horrible Mr. Peters,” she began anxiously.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Pepper always knows her own mind,”
said the parson, “and if she wants to attend
to the matter, it’s not for us, Almira, to interfere.”
He handled the napkin bundle gingerly
and moved off.</p>

<p>“It was perfectly dreadful, Jim Thompson
said, and you know he tells the truth, husband.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
She pattered after him. “Do see if you can’t
persuade her to let you see Mr. Peters. You
know you want to.”</p>

<p>“That I do!” declared the parson, his eyes
flashing. “Well, don’t you worry, Almira; it
will be attended to.”</p>

<p>“He ought to be driven out of town—that
old creature had,” cried his wife, with very red
cheeks. “Everybody hates him. Now I hope
this will make him leave Badgertown.”</p>

<p>“Softly there, Almira,” the parson patted
one of the red cheeks. “Badgertown must be
careful what it does. There are his poor wife
and Matilda to consider.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know it,” groaned Mrs. Henderson.
“Well, do try and get Mrs. Pepper to let you
fix the matter up.” She hurried over the old
flat stone. There in the doorway stood Miss
Jerusha.</p>

<p>“I sh’d think Adoniram had enough to do,
without taking up with Mis Pepper’s troubles,”
she said tartly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s his business to do what he can for
Badgertown people, Jerusha,” said Mrs. Henderson.</p>

<p>“Badgertown people!” sniffed Miss Jerusha.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
She set her spectacles straighter, and
glared at the parson’s wife. “You’ve all gone
mad over that little brown house family,” she
said. “For my part, I hate shiftless folks who
expect to be looked out for all the while.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever call the little brown house
people shiftless again in my presence.” The
parson’s wife got as tall as she could, even up
to her tiptoes. “Anybody with a heart would
be sorry for that poor brave woman, and those
dear children who are trying to help her. I
can’t think, Jerusha, how you can be so—so—”</p>

<p>She left the last word to look out for itself,
her voice trailing off. But she marched with a
high head past the long angular figure, and the
door of her husband’s study closed with a snap.</p>

<p>“Let me see ’em—let me see ’em!” Joel
prancing around in the little brown house
kitchen, stopped suddenly and twitched the
small calico sleeve.</p>

<p>“No,” said David, edging off. “I don’t
want anybody to see ’em.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to,” declared Joel, holding on
with both hands to the blouse as David whirled
around. “I saw ’em yesterday, and I’m going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
to see ’em again. Hold still, Dave. <i>Zip!</i>”</p>

<p>“There, now you’ve torn it!” Davie gave
a small cry of distress.</p>

<p>Joel’s stubby hands dropped and he stood
quite still in dismay.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t torn—torn—much,” he said quite
aghast.</p>

<p>“It’s torn—and now Mamsie will have to
work and mend it. O dear!”</p>

<p>With that the tears fell, and Davie threw
himself on the floor, and sobbed as if his heart
would break.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> the matter?” cried Polly, rushing
in from the bedroom, where she had been giving
Phronsie her breakfast of mush. For once
there was some real milk, for Doctor Fisher
had set a bottle on the kitchen table after his
visit to see how the measles were coming on.
“Oh, Davie!” She threw herself down beside
him. “Where are you hurt?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper hurried over the steps from the
provision room, where she had been looking
over the potatoes to see how long they would
last.</p>

<p>“I tore—tore—” said Joel, in the middle
of the kitchen floor. His face was working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
dreadfully and he twisted his hands together
trying not to cry.</p>

<p>“What did you do, Joe?” cried Polly, running
over to him.</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” cried Davie, throwing his arms
around her, “he didn’t mean to.”</p>

<p>“There—there,” said Mrs. Pepper, taking
him up to her lap. “Joel, come here and tell
Mother all about it.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t mean to,” began Davie again,
wiping up his tears.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Joey did mean to, Mamsie,
whatever it is,” said Polly, pulling him along.
He was digging one small fist into first one eye
and then the other, and saying at every step,
“I didn’t mean to, Mamsie,” and he threw himself
down and burrowed his face on top of
Davie’s legs in Mrs. Pepper’s lap.</p>

<p>“Stop saying you didn’t mean to, Joel, and
tell Mother what you did to Davie,” said Mrs.
Pepper firmly.</p>

<p>Joel put out a shaking hand and felt for the
torn place in the little calico blouse, Polly hanging
over them in great anxiety. “There,” he
said, “I didn’t mean to do it, Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“He means he’s torn Davie’s jacket,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Polly with a little gasp. “O dear me, Joel,
you’ve scared us almost to death!”</p>

<p>“Mamsie will have to work and mend it,”
howled Joel. With that Davie began again to
cry, and to burrow deeper against Mrs. Pepper’s
neck.</p>

<p>“For shame, Joel!” cried Polly. “It’s ever
so much worse to cry now than it was to tear
Davie’s jacket.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” cried Joel, bringing up his head
suddenly and gazing at her out of two black
eyes; the tears trailed down over his snubby
nose. “Is it really, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is, Joe,” she said decidedly.</p>

<p>“Then I’m not going to cry any more,”, declared
Joel, wiping off the last tear with the
back of one brown hand, and jumping up.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s Mother’s good boy,” said Mrs.
Pepper approvingly.</p>

<p>“Whatever made you tear Davie’s jacket,
Joe?” cried Polly, very much puzzled and running
after him.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see the red things on his legs,”
said Joel. “Oh, I’d ’a’ made Old Man Peters
squinge and squinge if I’d been there! This is
the way I’d have done.” Joel ran over to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
corner and seized the broom, and landed about
him so savagely that Polly flew off laughing,
and Davie joined in with a merry shout, until
the little old kitchen fairly rang with the noise.</p>

<p>“Yes—sir-ee!” said Joel, prancing madly
around, “that’s the way I’d ’a’ squinged him if
I’d been there.”</p>

<p>Davie slid out of Mother Pepper’s lap and
ran after him, the torn bit of calico flapping at
the end of his blouse.</p>

<p>“Let me, Joel,” he cried, trying to reach the
broom as Joel pranced on.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t do it,” said Joel. “I must
squinge Old Man Peters myself,” holding the
broom very high. Then he saw Davie’s face.
“You may have it,” he said.</p>

<p>Polly ran into the bedroom and came back
on her tiptoes. “Phronsie’s asleep,” she said.
“Now I’m awfully glad, for I can clean out
the stove. Then I can get the bread in.” She
ran over and knelt down before the old stove,
and presently there was a great to-do with the
brush and the little shovel and the old woolen
cloths.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper sighed as she rolled up in a
newspaper two coats that she had just finished.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
“I don’t know what I should ever do without
you, Polly,” she said, looking over at her.</p>

<p>“Don’t you, Mamsie?” cried Polly in great
delight, and sitting back on her heels, she
brought up a countenance with long black
streaks running across it. “Don’t you really,
Mamsie?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said Mrs. Pepper, “and that
is a fact. Mother wouldn’t know what to do
without you. But dear me, child, what a pair
of black hands—and your face, Polly!” as she
went into the bedroom to put on her bonnet.</p>

<p>Polly looked down at her hands. Then she
burst out laughing. “I brushed back my hair,”
she said, “it tumbled into my eyes so,” and she
jumped up and ran to the cracked looking glass
hanging over in the corner. “My! what a
sight I am!”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” cried Joel, rushing over.
“Don’t wash it off, Polly, let me see!”</p>

<p>David flung down the broom and tumbled
after. “Let me see, too, Polly.”</p>

<p>“I look just like that old black man who used
to come after rags,” said Polly, turning around
on them and holding up her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, you do—you do!” howled Joel in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
huge delight, while Davie crowed and clapped
his hands. “You do, just exactly like him,
Polly!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Polly. She rushed
out and came running back with Ben’s old cap
on her head and her arms in his coat. “Now
wouldn’t you think I was that old black man?”
she said, stalking up and down the kitchen crying
out, “Any rags, Mam?” and she swung
the big potato bag at them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Polly,” screamed Davie in a transport,
“you <i>are</i> that old black man,” while Joel
marched after echoing, “Any rags, Mam?”
and swinging an imaginary bag at every step
he took.</p>

<p>Suddenly Polly stopped, tore off the cap and
the coat. “Take back the potato bag into the
provision room, Joel,” she said, tossing it to
him. “I forgot the stove, and the bread has
got to go in. O dear me!” She flew over to
the sink, and presently back she came. “There
now, I’m scrubbed clean, but I’ll get all black
again, I suppose,” and she kneeled down again
before the stove.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper came out of the bedroom and
stopped a minute by the green door to smile at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
them all. Then she went out with her bundle
to take to Mr. Atkins at the store; but first
there was another errand of importance to
attend to, so she turned off at the cross-road.
The smile had dropped away from her folded
lips, as she stepped swiftly along toward the
Peters farm.</p>

<p>“Here she comes—here’s Mis Pepper!”
cried Matilda. “Do stop wringin’ your hands,
Ma. You hain’t done nothin’ else sence yesterday.
Mis Pepper can’t blame us.”</p>

<p>“O dear,” mourned Mrs. Peters. “’Twas
th’ quince sass that made all th’ trouble.”</p>

<p>“’Twarn’t th’ quince sass at all,” contradicted
Matilda flatly. “Pa never said a word
about it. Do stop—Mis Pepper’s at th’
door.”</p>

<p>“<i>Rat-tat!</i>” went the old iron knocker. Matilda
jumped, all her nerves askew, while Mrs.
Peters sank down in the nearest chair.</p>

<p>“O dear, there ain’t time to git on a clean
apurn.” Matilda opened the big door—her
tongue clapped up to the roof of her mouth,
and she couldn’t find a word to say.</p>

<p>“Is your father in?” asked Mrs. Pepper
pleasantly. Then she looked into the scared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
face. “Don’t feel badly—you couldn’t help
it,” she said.</p>

<p>Matilda twisted her hands in her dirty apron.
“We feel dreadful—Ma an’ me,” she said,
and burst out crying.</p>

<p>“There—there,” said Mrs. Pepper soothingly,
trying to pat the nervous hands.
“Don’t, Matilda; your mother will hear you.
Can I see your father?” She stepped in and
shut the door.</p>

<p>“He’s in there.” Matilda twitched out one
hand from beneath the apron, and pointed a
shaking finger to the little room that old Mr.
Peters called his office. Mrs. Pepper knocked
at the door.</p>

<p>“You better go right in ef you want to see
him,” said Matilda in a loud whisper, “for he’ll
sneak out th’ back door, ef he knows it’s you.”
So Mrs. Pepper opened the door, and none too
soon. Old Man Peters was crowding his long
legs out of the big chair where he sat behind
his desk, his eyes on the door leading out to
the back yard.</p>

<p>“Oh, come in, Mis Pepper,” he mumbled, his
long face getting redder and redder. “Take
a chair an’ set.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“I do not wish to sit down, Mr. Peters,”
said Mrs. Pepper. “What I have to say will
take but a few moments. I have come to see
you about my boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—” grunted the old man in a
terrible alarm. “Well, p’raps ’twas a mistake,”
he twitched the papers on his desk with
nervous fingers, then finally ran them through
his shock of grizzled hair. “I didn’t mean to
hurt th’ boy none. But mebbe ’twas a mistake.
You better set, Mis Pepper.” He pointed to a
broken-backed chair, the only one provided for
his farm-hands when they went to wrangle
over their hard-earned wages.</p>

<p>“It was more than a mistake, Mr. Peters,”
said Mrs. Pepper in a clear voice, and ignoring
the invitation.</p>

<p>“Well—mebbe—mebbe,” said the old
man, wriggling around in his big chair. “See
here now,” he suddenly stopped and looked in a
tremor into her black eyes, “I’ll give you some
money, an’ that’ll fix it up. How much do ye
want?” he asked in an anguished tone.</p>

<p>“Money could never fix up a thing like this,”
said Mrs. Pepper. Her tone was quiet, but the
black eyes blazed. Old Man Peters’s hand fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
in relief from the handle of his money drawer,
but he slunk down in his chair.</p>

<p>“The only reparation you can make, Mr.
Peters,” Mrs. Pepper went on, “is to be very
sure that you will never lay a hand again on a
Badgertown child; not only upon my child, but
upon <i>any</i> child. You understand that?”</p>

<p>“Ye—yes,” mumbled the old man.</p>

<p>“And one more thing. That is, that you
will treat your wife and Matilda as women
should be treated.”</p>

<p>“They’re well enough off,” declared Old
Man Peters suddenly. Then he snarled out,
“An’ what bus’ness is it of yours, Mis Pepper,
I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“Very well. If you don’t promise this, I
shall see that the injury to my boy is atoned for.
I shall give the matter into the hands of the
town authorities, Mr. Peters.”</p>

<p>“Here—here—” screamed the old man,
flinging out both hands, as she moved off.
“Stop, Mis Pepper! I didn’t mean to say I
wouldn’t promise. Yes—yes—I do! Will
you stop! I say I will!”</p>

<p>“And Badgertown will see that you keep
that promise,” said Mrs. Pepper. Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
opened the door. Matilda, who had a shaking
eye at the keyhole, nearly fell over backward
on the entry oilcloth.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mis Pepper,” she gasped, seizing the
strong arm. “Ma’s takin’ on somethin’ awful
in th’ sittin’ room.”</p>

<p>“She won’t do that long,” said Mrs. Pepper
grimly. “Come, Tildy.”</p>

<p>“Oh me—oh my!” old Mrs. Peters was
throwing herself from one side of the rickety
sofa in the sitting-room and moaning, with her
fingers in her ears, when they came in.</p>

<p>“She’s got th’ high-strikes,” declared Matilda
with big eyes. “I must go up garret and
git some feathers an’ burn ’em right under her
nose.”</p>

<p>“Come back—no need for that, Matilda.”
Mrs. Pepper sat down on the sofa and drew the
poor gray head into her arms. “There—there,”
she said, just as if one of the Five Little
Peppers was cuddled within them. “You’re
going to see better times, Mrs. Peters. Your
husband has promised to treat you and Matilda
as women should be treated.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Peters not understanding, wailed
on, burrowing deeper into the kind arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Tildy jumped to her feet. “Oh my soul an’
body—did you make Pa say <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Peters promised it,” said Mrs. Pepper
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” Tildy set up a trot to the
other end of the room, coming back to snap her
fingers in glee. Then the joy went out of her
face. “Pa never’ll keep that promise in all the
world,” she gasped, drooping miserably.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt that the promise will be
kept, Matilda,” said Mrs. Pepper. “And if it
isn’t, why you just come to me.” Then she
laid Mrs. Peters’s head back on the old sofa
and went out and shut the door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE DARK CLOUD OVER THE
LITTLE BROWN HOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“YOU don’t say!” Old Man Beebe turned
around on his little ladder where he was
reaching down a pair of number six shoes for
a customer. “Sho’ now, I am beat, Mis
Brown! Mebbe ’tain’t true.” He held the
shoes aloft, the long strings dangling down.</p>

<p>“There ain’t no morsel o’ doubt about it,”
said Mrs. Brown decidedly. “I’ve jest come
from the store, an’ Mr. Atkins himself told me.
I can’t wait all day, Mr. Beebe; an’ I said gaiters.
I don’t want no shoes.”</p>

<p>“You said shoes,” said Mr. Beebe. “However
did I git up here, ef you hadn’t asked for
’em.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know nothin’ about th’ workin’ o’
your mind, Mr. Beebe,” said Mrs. Brown, “I
said gaiters as plain as day—and do hurry!”
She whipped the ends of her shawl impatiently
around her gaunt figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“I d’no’s I have any gaiters—that is—that’ll
fit you,” said the little shoemaker, putting
the “number sixes” into their box, and
slowly fitting on the cover. “P’raps I have a
pair on the lower shelf.” He got down laboriously
from the ladder, put it in the corner and
began to rummage his stock.</p>

<p>“An’ there’s my bread waitin’ to go in th’
oven, an’ I’ve got cake to bake for the sewin’
s’ciety,—do hurry, Mr. Beebe.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose they’ve got to have rubber sides,”
mused Mr. Beebe, getting down on his knees,
to explore behind the chintz curtains that fell
from the lowest shelf.</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” said Mrs. Brown, impatiently,
“gaiters is gaiters, ain’t they? An’ I
never saw a pair without them rubber sides to
’em, did you, Mr. Beebe?”</p>

<p>“I d’no’s I did,” said the little shoemaker, his
head under the curtain. “Well, now here’s a
pair, I do believe,” and he dragged out a box,
whipped off the cover and disclosed a pair with
elastic sides. “Them’s Congress gaiters,” he
said, “an’ they look as if they’d fit like your
skin.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hope so,” said Mrs. Brown, putting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
out her generous foot. “An’ do hurry an’
try ’em on, for mercy’s sakes!”</p>

<p>“I’m hurryin’ as fast as I can,” said Mr.
Beebe, coming over to the bench where the customers
always sat for the shoes to be tried on,
“but you’ve upset me so about that bad news.
Sho’ now!—to think that anythin’ should happen
to the little brown house folks.”</p>

<p>“What’s that—what’s that, Pa?” Mrs.
Beebe’s head appeared in the doorway between
the little shop and the sitting-room. She had
been frying doughnuts and she carried one in
now on a blue plate, as she always did while
they were nice and hot. “What’s th’ matter
with th’ little brown house folks? Oh, how do
you do, Mis Brown?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown’s nose wrinkled up appreciatively
at sight of the doughnut.</p>

<p>“I hope nothin’, Ma,” said Mr. Beebe, not
looking at the plate.</p>

<p>“You always have such luck with your
doughnuts, Mis Beebe,” said Mrs. Brown
longingly.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, anyway?” demanded Mrs.
Beebe, setting down the plate on the counter
that ran on one side of the little shop, and coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
up to the shoe-bench. “What was you
sayin’, Pa, about th’ Pepperses?”</p>

<p>“Polly’s got the measles now.”</p>

<p>“Good land o’ Goshen!” exclaimed old Mrs.
Beebe. Then she sat down on the other end of
the bench and folded her plump hands.</p>

<p>“P’raps ’tain’t true,” he said, with trembling
hands pulling on the gaiter.</p>

<p>“That’s too tight,” declared Mrs. Brown,
wrenching her mind from the doughnuts and
twisting her foot from one side to the other.</p>

<p>“’Twon’t be when th’ rubber ’lastic has got
stretched,” said Mr. Beebe.</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ then the ’lastic will be all wore
out, an’ bulge,” said Mrs. Brown discontentedly.
“Hain’t you got another pair, Mr.
Beebe?”</p>

<p>“Not your size,” said the little shoemaker.</p>

<p>“Well, if Polly Pepper’s got th’ measles, I’m
goin’ right down to the little brown house,” declared
old Mrs. Beebe, getting up from the
shoe-bench. “I’ll set out your dinner, Pa, the
cold meat an’ pie, and there’s some hot soup on
the stove. I’m goin’ to stay an’ help Mis Pepper,”
and she waddled out.</p>

<p>“Well, for mercy’s sake, Mr. Beebe, try on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
th’ other gaiter. I’ve got to git home some
time to-day,” said Mrs. Brown crossly, all hope
of a doughnut coming her way now gone entirely.</p>

<p>The little shoemaker stood by the door of his
shop thoughtfully jingling the silver pieces in
his hands, after his customer had gone out.</p>

<p>“To think o’ Polly bein’ took! O dear,
dear! I declare I forgot to give Ma some pink
sticks to take to the childern.” He hurried out
to the small entry, took down his coat and old
cap and rammed his hands into his big pockets.</p>

<p>“Here they are, just as I saved ’em for Joel.”
Then he locked up his little shop and ambled
down the cobble-stones to overtake old Mrs.
Beebe on her way to the little brown house.</p>

<p>But she got there first and opened the old
green door without knocking. Mrs. Pepper
was coming out of the bedroom with a bowl
and a spoon in her hands. Her face was very
white, but she tried to smile a welcome.</p>

<p>“Land alive!” exclaimed old Mrs. Beebe in
a loud whisper. “Is Polly took?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” Mrs. Beebe sank down
in Mother Pepper’s calico-covered chair.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
“That beats all—to think that Polly’s took!
Whatever’ll you do <i>now</i>!”</p>

<p>“Take care,” warned Mrs. Pepper, “she’ll
hear you,” and she pointed to the bedroom.</p>

<p>“I’m whisperin’,” said old Mrs. Beebe, holding
her plump hands tightly together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper hurried up to the loft to see how
Ben was getting on.</p>

<p>And in came the little shoemaker, his round
face quite red, he had hurried so.</p>

<p>“Is she bad?” The whisper was so much
worse than that of old Mrs. Beebe, that she
got out of the big chair and hurried over to
him. “Pa, you mustn’t—she’ll hear you.”
She pointed to the bedroom and twitched his
sleeve.</p>

<p>“I ain’t a-talkin’, I’m whisperin’,” he said.
“Is Polly bad, Ma?” He pulled out his bandanna
handkerchief and wiped his anxious
face.</p>

<p>“Oh, I d’no,” said Mrs. Beebe disconsolately.
“Everything bad that Mis Pepper gits,
deary me!”</p>

<p>“Well, I brought some pink sticks for Joel
and Davie,” said old Mr. Beebe, pulling out the
paper from his pocket. “There Ma,” he laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
them down on the table. “Where’s th’ boys?”
he peered around the old kitchen.</p>

<p>“They’re over to Deacon Blodgett’s, I
s’pose,” said Mrs. Beebe. “O dear me, they’ve
got to work worse’n ever, now Ben’s sick.”</p>

<p>“Sho, now!” exclaimed the little shoemaker,
dreadfully upset. “Where’s Mis Pepper?”</p>

<p>“Up there,” old Mrs. Beebe pointed to the
loft stairs.</p>

<p>“I d’no what Mis Pepper is goin’ to do now
that Polly is took with th’ measles,” said Mr.
Beebe in a loud whisper. “Hem! O dear
me!” and he blew his nose violently.</p>

<p>“Hush, Pa! You do speak dretful loud,”
as Mrs. Pepper came down the loft stairs.</p>

<p>“It’s good of you to come, Mr. Beebe,” she
said, hurrying into the bedroom and closing
the door.</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” cried Polly, flying into the middle
of the bed; the tears were racing down
under the bandage that Dr. Fisher had tied
over her eyes that morning. “Whatever will
you do now that I’ve got ’em—Oh, Mamsie!”
She threw her arms around Mother Pepper.</p>

<p>“Polly—Polly, child!” Mrs. Pepper held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
her close. “You mustn’t cry. Don’t you
know what Dr. Fisher told you. There—there,”
she patted the brown hair as Polly
snuggled up to her.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” said Polly, the tears
tumbling over each other in their mad race
down her cheeks. “I don’t mind my eyes, if
only I could help you. Oh, what will you do,
Mamsie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will get along,” said Mrs. Pepper in
a cheerful voice. “And just think how good
Joel is.”</p>

<p>“It’s good Joey hasn’t got the measles,”
said Polly, trying to smile through her tears.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” said Mrs. Pepper. “And Deacon
Blodgett says he does splendidly working
about the place. And Davie, too—oh, Polly,
just think what a comfort those two boys
are.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Polly, trying to speak
cheerfully, “but I do wish I could help you sew
on the coats,” she said, and her face drooped
further within Mother Pepper’s arms.</p>

<p>“It’s just because you have sewed so much
that your eyes are bad.” Mrs. Pepper couldn’t
repress the sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Mamsie, now don’t you feel badly,” Polly
brought her head up suddenly. “Oh, I wish
I could see your face—don’t you, Mamsie?”
She clutched her mother tightly, and the tears
began to come again.</p>

<p>“Polly,” said Mrs. Pepper, “now you and I
have both got to be brave. It’s not time for
crying, and you must just be mother’s girl, and
lie down and keep warm under the clothes.
That’s the very best way to help me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” said Polly, as Mrs. Pepper tucked
her in under the old comforter.</p>

<p>But although old Mrs. Beebe was kind as
could be, and Grandma Bascom hobbled over
every now and then, and Parson Henderson
and his wife helped in every imaginable way,
a black cloud settled over the little brown house.
And one day Badgertown heard the news:
“Joel Pepper is took sick with th’ measles, and
he’s awful bad.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” said Mr. Atkins, turning
off with the jug he was filling from the big
barrel of molasses for a customer, “that boy
can’t be sick.”</p>

<p>“Well, he is,” declared the customer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
“Look out! th’ ’lasses is all a-runnin’ over th’
floor!”</p>

<p>“Thunderation!” The storekeeper jumped
back and picked his foot out of the sticky mess,
while he thrust the jug under the bunghole.
“Hold your tongue, Timothy Bliss! Joel Pepper
was in here yist’day—no, that was David
bringin’ back th’ coats Mis Pepper had sewed—’twas
day before yist’day Joe came runnin’ in,
smart as a cricket. He warn’t goin’ to have no
squeezles, he said, No, Sir!” Mr. Atkins
turned off the spigot sharply, and set the jug
on the counter with a thud.</p>

<p>“He’s got ’em now at any rate,” said Mr.
Bliss solemnly. “An’ Mis Beebe says they
wouldn’t wonder ef he was goin’ to die.”</p>

<p>“<i>Die!</i>” roared the storekeeper. “Ain’t
you ’shamed, Timothy Bliss, to stand there
sayin’ sech stuff! Joel Pepper can’t die.”
Yet Mr. Atkins gripped the counter with both
hands, while everything in his store seemed to
spin around.</p>

<p>“Mis Beebe said—standin’ in th’ door o’
th’ shoe-shop as I come by,” began Mr. Bliss,
leaning up against the counter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“Don’t tell me no more,” interrupted the
storekeeper, waving both sticky hands excitedly;
“it’s scand’lous startin’ such tales.”
Then he rushed over to the small door connecting
with his house. “Ma—Ma,” he
screamed, “Joel Pepper’s awful sick with the
measles!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” Mrs. Atkins came to the
top of the stairs, her sweeping-cap on her head
and a dust-brush in her hand. “O me, O
my!” she mourned. “What will Mis Pepper
do now, with both of her boys took sick?”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s got Davie,” said the storekeeper,
determined to get some comfort, and
hanging to the newel post.</p>

<p>“Davie’s so little.” Mrs. Atkins sat down
on the upper stair. “He’d help all he could,
but he’s so little,” she repeated.</p>

<p>“David’s awful smart,” said Mr. Atkins.</p>

<p>“I know it; they’re all smart, them Pepper
childern, but Joel’s so up an’ comin’, you can’t
think of Davie somehow as takin’ hold o’
things. Seth Atkins, you’ve got ’lasses all over
your trousers!”</p>

<p>She ran down the stairs and peered anxiously
at her husband’s legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>The storekeeper twitched away. “That’s
Timothy Bliss’ fault. He scaret me so about
Joe,” and he darted back into the store.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I’m goin’ to help Mamsie.” David stood
in the middle of the kitchen, twisting his hands
together anxiously. “I’m getting to be real
big now, Mrs. Beebe,” and he stood on his
tiptoes.</p>

<p>“Bless your heart!” exclaimed old Mrs.
Beebe, making gruel on the old stove, “so you
be, Davie.”</p>

<p>“And pretty soon I’ll be as big as—as
Joel.” Then he swallowed hard at the sound
of Joel’s name.</p>

<p>“So you will—so you will,” said Mrs.
Beebe. “An’ you help your mother now,
Davie boy.”</p>

<p>“Do I?” cried David. A little pink spot
came on each cheek, and he unclenched his
hands, for he wasn’t going to cry now.</p>

<p>“To be sure you do,” declared Mrs. Beebe,
bobbing her cap at him. “Your Ma told me
yest’day she depended on you.”</p>

<p>“Did she?” David ran over to clutch her
apron, the pink spots getting quite rosy. “Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
I’m going to do just everything that Ben and
Joel did—I am, Mrs. Beebe.”</p>

<p>“Well, you look out, you don’t work too
hard, Davie,” Mrs. Beebe stopped stirring a
minute, and regarded him anxiously, “that
would worry your Ma most dretful. There,
that’s done.” She swished the spoon about a
few times, then poured the gruel into a bowl.
“Now, then, I’ll give it to Ben.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me,” cried Davie, putting up both
hands eagerly.</p>

<p>“You’re too tired—you’ve ben a-runnin’ all
th’ mornin’,” began Mrs. Beebe, yet her stout
legs ached badly.</p>

<p>“I’m not tired,” cried Davie, and in a minute
he had the bowl and was going carefully
up the loft stairs.</p>

<p>“Now that blessed child is just like the rest
o’ th’ childern,” mused old Mrs. Beebe, sinking
down in a chair. “Davie’s quiet, but he get’s
there all the same.”</p>

<p>And Davie’s little legs “got there all the
same” through the dark days when Joel went
deeper and deeper into the gloom. And the
little brown house people held their breath in
very dread of the coming hours. And good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Doctor Fisher lay awake every night after the
day’s hard work, going over and over in his
troubled mind how he might save Mrs. Pepper’s
boy.</p>

<p>“O dear me!” a voice broke in upon the
woodshed, where Davie sat on the chopping-block.
His legs ached dreadfully, but he
wasn’t thinking of them. He was awfully
afraid he was going to cry after all, and he
twisted up his small cheeks, and held his hands
together oh, oh so tightly!</p>

<p>“Just as I expected,” Miss Jerusha Henderson
put her head in, “all this talk about the
Pepper childern workin’ to help their mother
is just rubbish,” she sniffed and came up to
the chopping-block; “there you set, you lazy
boy, you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a lazy boy,” said David, getting
off from the chopping-block. “Mamsie told
me there wasn’t anything to do now.” His
little cheeks burned like fire.</p>

<p>“Anything to do!” Miss Jerusha raised her
long fingers and waved them about. “Did I
ever—and look at all this messy place! Why
ain’t you choppin’ wood, I sh’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Mamsie told me not to do anything till she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
called me.” His head ached dreadfully, and
he wanted to run, but he stood his ground.</p>

<p>“If ever I saw a woman who spoiled her
childern, it’s your Ma,” said Miss Jerusha,
sniffing again. “It’s no wonder she has
trouble.”</p>

<p>David swallowed hard, then he looked up
into her snappy little black eyes. “I wish
you’d go away,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“Of all the impertinent boys!” exclaimed
the parson’s sister, an angry flush spreading
over her gaunt face. “Well, I’m not going, I
can tell you that. And I shall come every day
and do my duty by you, David Pepper.”</p>

<p>“No,” said David, “you mustn’t come any
more.”</p>

<p>“And I am going to speak to your Ma now,
and tell her what a naughty boy you are.”
Miss Jerusha picked up her gingham gown and
went off on angry feet out of the woodshed.</p>

<p>David ran past her, and up to the door of the
little brown house. When she got there he
was holding the latch with both hands.</p>

<p>“You get off that door-step!” cried Miss
Jerusha, now in a towering passion, and seizing
his little calico blouse, “I declare I just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
ache to give you a whipping!” She raised one
long hand threateningly. “You don’t get any
with that silly mother of yours. Get off that
door-step, I say! It’s my duty to speak to your
Ma.”</p>

<p>“You can’t,” said Davie stoutly, “because
you can’t get in.” He gripped the latch
tighter, and his blue eyes flashed just like
Mother Pepper’s black ones.</p>

<p>“Can’t, hey?” Miss Jerusha’s hard hand
was laid not very gently on David’s little ones
holding the old latch. Her other was raised
threateningly. “Let go of that latch, or I’ll
box your ears.”</p>

<p>Davie clung tighter than ever to the latch.
Down came Miss Jerusha’s hand on his small
ear. An angry red spot was on her cheek, and
she struck again.</p>

<p>“What’s this—what’s this?” Doctor
Fisher came briskly up the path. The parson’s
sister turned suddenly, her hand falling to her
side.</p>

<p>“This boy has been very naughty,” she said,
the blood rushing over her gaunt cheeks.</p>

<p>Dr. Fisher set his big spectacles straight,
and regarded her keenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“He has sassed me by holding this door, an’
I’m goin’ in to see his Ma.”</p>

<p>“Davie’s just right,” said the little doctor.
He turned to give an approving smile to him
still clinging to the old latch.</p>

<p>“<i>Jest right!</i>” screamed Miss Jerusha, in a
towering passion. “Do you know who I be?
I’m Parson Henderson’s sister.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Doctor Fisher, “and
I’m dreadfully sorry for the parson. I wish I
could help him. But as for David here, he’s
got my permission to keep out anybody he
wants to. Mrs. Pepper isn’t to be worried by
visitors.”</p>

<p>“I shall report you to the Parson,” said
Miss Jerusha, getting off from the flat stone.</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” said Doctor Fisher, as she stalked
down the path. Then he went into the little
brown house to battle for Joel’s life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>SUNLIGHT THROUGH THE CLOUD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DEACON BLODGETT exclaimed,
“’Tain’t no use, I can’t set myself to
work on nothin’,” and then leaned helplessly
against the barn door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blodgett sighed. She was far beyond
words. At last she threw her apron over her
head. When she did that, the Deacon knew
she was pretty far gone.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Ma,” he begged, “take on so.
Hem!” He swallowed hard and smote one
big hand across the other. “’Twouldn’t be so
bad ef I c’d jest see David a-runnin’ in to pile
wood. Land! how smart that boy works to
try to take Joel’s place!”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of Joel, Pa,” said Mrs. Blodgett
in a muffled voice. “Mercy me, ef he sh’d
die!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Joel ain’t a-goin’ to die,” declared Deacon
Blodgett, stoutly, “don’t you think it, Ma.”</p>

<p>“I d’no,” Mrs. Blodgett shook her head till
the apron flapped dismally. “No mortal man
c’d do more’n Doctor Fisher. Do look down
th’ road, Pa, an’ see ef his gig is comin’.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Fisher won’t leave the little brown
house to-day till Joel’s better,” declared the
Deacon, not moving; but his eyes roved anxiously
up and down the thoroughfare.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d go over to Mis Pepper’s, an’
find out how Joel is,” Mrs. Blodgett’s voice
came out in a thin little quaver from behind the
apron.</p>

<p>The Deacon braced up firmer yet against the
barn door. Then he said, “You better go
yourself, Mother.”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” ejaculated his wife with a shiver,
“I’m about sick as ’tis now, I couldn’t never
face Mis Pepper—O dear me!”</p>

<p>“Neither can I—an’ all is, I’m goin’ to
work.” Deacon Blodgett brought himself suddenly
away from the barn door and strode off.</p>

<p>“Where you goin’, Pa?” Down fell Mrs.
Blodgett’s apron from her head.</p>

<p>“Down to th’ east paster,” said the Deacon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
not turning his head. “I can’t stand still no
longer an’ think o’ nothin’ but that boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t a-goin’ to stay to home,” declared
Mrs. Blodgett. “Nobody to talk to but
Mary Ann, an’ she keeps harpin’ on the Pepperses.
I’ll go down an’ see Grandma Bascom.”</p>

<p>So she tied on her bonnet with trembling
fingers and hurried off. When she left the
main road and struck the little lane that led
down to Grandma’s house, she stopped
abruptly. “O dear me! that’s almost as bad
as to go to Mis Pepper’s, for Mis Bascom’ll
take on somethin’ dreadful. My! what’s that
in th’ bushes!”</p>

<p>A little crackling noise struck her ears, and
one or two small branches stirred in the shrubbery
alongside the road. There wasn’t any
wind to speak of, and Mrs. Blodgett paused in
fright, her fingers on her lips; but being no
coward, she marched up and shook the nearest
bush.</p>

<p>“We don’t want no tramps in Badgertown,”
she began. Then she burst out, “Why, <i>David
Pepper</i>!”</p>

<p>There on the ground, his face grubbing into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the grass, lay David squirming back and forth,
his little hands clenched.</p>

<p>“You poor little creeter, you!” Mrs. Blodgett
got down on the ground beside him, and
fairly gathered him up to her ample bosom.
“You couldn’t cry in the little brown house,
an’ so you’ve come out here. Poor lamb!”</p>

<p>“<i>Joel!</i>” ’Twas all that Davie was capable
of.</p>

<p>“There—there—now you jest stop!”
Mrs. Blodgett spoke sharply, she was so scared,
for the sobs were shaking David from top to
toe; but to stop was beyond him, so she laid
him down on the grass.</p>

<p>“Now I’m jest goin’ to your house an’ see
how things is, Davie. Then I’ll come back an’
tell you.” She got up with difficulty and shook
her calico gown free from the dirt and mold.</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t!” screamed David, sitting
up. “Oh, Mrs. Blodgett, <i>don’t</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m goin’, Davie, an’ you better come
along of me.” She held out her hand.
“Your ma would want you to.” “’Tain’t
half so bad as to let him stay here an’ be scared
to death in them bushes,” she reflected.</p>

<p>“Would Mamsie want me to?” asked Davie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
blinking at her through the tears that ran down
his cheeks.</p>

<p>“She certainly would,” declared Mrs. Blodgett.
“O my!” she cried, pricking up her
ears. “Well, you wait here a minute. I’ll
come back for you.”</p>

<p>She darted down the road, if such locomotion
as she set up could be called darting, and presently
she saw just ahead Dr. Fisher’s old gig.</p>

<p>“<i>Wait!</i>” she tried to scream, but her tongue
flapped up to the roof of her mouth and stuck
there, as she panted on.</p>

<p>A farmer’s boy in an old wagon coming
around the corner thrust his fingers in his
mouth and gave such a whistle that the little
doctor thrust out his head.</p>

<p>“Lady wants you—she’s a-runnin’ fit to
split,” said the boy, pointing to the Deacon’s
wife pounding the dust up dreadfully at every
step.</p>

<p>Dr. Fisher pulled up the old horse and
hopped out of the gig.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, is that you, Mrs. Blodgett!”
he exclaimed, hurrying to meet her.</p>

<p>The Deacon’s wife was beyond speech, only
being able to puff, her hand at her side and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
face very red. So the little Doctor began the
conversation.</p>

<p>“Do you know where David Pepper is?” he
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>That made Mrs. Blodgett find her tongue.
“He’s in them bushes,” she said, pointing a
shaking finger back down the road.</p>

<p>“Get in—get right in,” said Dr. Fisher
joyfully, taking hold of her fat arm, and hurrying
her to the gig, “and we’ll get Davie—his
mother’s awfully worried about him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Blodgett had no chance to speak further
until the gig was well under way for
David’s bush. “He don’t look as ef Joel was
worse,” she said to herself, peering into the
little Doctor’s face, “but I’m mortal afraid to
ask.”</p>

<p>“And now that Joel is going to get well,”
said Doctor Fisher, “why we must get David
home to his mother.”</p>

<p>“<i>Joel goin’ to git well</i>,” screamed Mrs. Blodgett,
nipping his arm, and turning her red face
toward him.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” declared the little Doctor.
“Praise God—Joel is saved to us all!” His
face was very grave, but there was a light in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
the eyes back of the big spectacles that made
the Deacon’s wife say brokenly, “Bless th’
Lord!”</p>

<p>“You may well say that,” said Dr. Fisher
brokenly.</p>

<p>“An’ you too—I say bless you!” cried the
Deacon’s wife heartily, “for I guess th’ Lord
Himself can’t do much ef folks won’t help, too.
Well, here’s David in that bush there.”</p>

<p>Dr. Fisher pulled up the old horse sharply,
tossed the reins over the dashboard and leaped
out over the wheel.</p>

<p>“Hulloa, David!” he cried, pushing back
the branches. “Well—well!”</p>

<p>Davie shivered and shrank back further
under the bush.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joey is going to get well,” said the
little Doctor cheerily, poking his big spectacles
in under the branches.</p>

<p>David sprang up and threw his arms convulsively
around the little Doctor’s neck.</p>

<p>“There—there—good gracious, you hug
worse’n a bear, Dave,” cried Dr. Fisher,
bundling him up in his arms. “Now then, hop
in with you!” He deposited him on the old
leather seat, and jumped into the gig beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
him. “We must get you home to your mother
before you can say Jack Robinson!”</p>

<p>If David’s legs had a hard time of it when
Joel was so sick, it was nothing to the way
they had to run now that the dark cloud had
passed over the little brown house.</p>

<p>Up and down the loft stairs where Joel
tossed impatiently on the shake-down, Davie
toiled to suit Joel’s demands, who wanted something
every minute. At last Mrs. Pepper interfered.
“You mustn’t, Joey,” she said;
“Davie will be worn out.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been sick,” declared Joel, with an important
air, “and Dave likes to get things.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said Davie eagerly, and lifting
a pale face. “Do let me, Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“There, you see,” said Joel triumphantly.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mother Pepper, “you mustn’t
send him over the stairs so much, Joey. He’s
very tired.”</p>

<p>“I’m not much tired,” said David, wishing
that Mamsie wouldn’t keep him from waiting
on Joel.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are, Davie child. You’ve been
mother’s boy all these weeks, and worked so
hard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>A pink flush crept all over David’s pale little
face. He folded his hands, and stood quite
still.</p>

<p>“I’m mother’s boy, too,” declared Joel,
“ain’t I, Mamsie?” He rolled over in the
shake-down, and fastened his black eyes on
her.</p>

<p>“Indeed you are,” declared Mrs. Pepper
warmly, “both of you. But, Joel, I want you
to remember how hard Davie has worked all the
time that Ben and you have been sick. You
must never forget that, Joey.”</p>

<p>“I won’t forget,” said Joel, “and I want to
get up.” With that he gave his legs a fling,
and ran his toes out of bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joel,” cried Mother Pepper in alarm,
“you mustn’t do that. It is the very worst
thing that could happen to a boy with the
measles—to get his feet cold.” And she
tucked him in again snug and tight.</p>

<p>“My toes are hot,” said Joel, wriggling
worse than ever, and making the old comforter
bulge up at the side.</p>

<p>“I’ll sit on it, Mamsie, and hold it down,”
said Davie, getting on the edge of the bed.
“There.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“<i>Ow!</i> No, you don’t,” declared Joel, bouncing
up so suddenly that Davie slid off to the
floor in a little heap.</p>

<p>“Joel—Joel!” reproved Mother Pepper.</p>

<p>“Well, he was sitting all over my toes,” declared
Joel, throwing his legs about, so that
Mother Pepper had to tuck him all up again.</p>

<p>“Can’t you pin him in, Mamsie?” asked
Davie, picking himself up, to hover over the
bed. “I will get your big shawl-pin,” and he
started for the stairs.</p>

<p>“Hoh! I ain’t going to be pinned in bed,”
cried Joel in a dudgeon. “Mamsie, make him
come back,” he whimpered. “Don’t let him
get the pin, I’ll be good.”</p>

<p>“See that you are then, Joel,” said Mrs.
Pepper. “Come back, Davie,” as he was half-way
over the stairs. “Joel is going to be a
good boy, and keep his feet in bed.”</p>

<p>“O dear,” grumbled Joel, flouncing all over
the bed as David ran back, “I want Polly to
come up and tell me a story.”</p>

<p>“Polly can’t come now,” said Mrs. Pepper.
There was a little white line around her mouth;
she had her back to the bed, so that Joel could
not see her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“She never comes,” grumbled Joel. “Oh,
I’m <i>so</i> hot. Why can’t she come, Mamsie?”</p>

<p>“Can’t I tell a story?” said David, coming
close. “I will, Joey.”</p>

<p>“Phoh!” Joel bent his black eyes on him.
“You can’t tell a story, Dave Pepper.”</p>

<p>“Now I think Davie could tell a story very
nicely,” said Mother Pepper with a smile for
David.</p>

<p>“I can try,” said Davie, his heart beating
dreadfully at the mere thought. But something
had to be done to keep Joel from finding
out that Polly’s eyes were so bad.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Joel ungraciously, “but I
know it won’t be good for anything.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s very nice of you, Davie, and I
know it will be a good story, Joel.” Mrs. Pepper
gave a final tuck-in to the old comforter,
and went quickly down-stairs.</p>

<p>“Get up on the bed, Dave,” said Joel, beginning
to feel better about the story, since
Mamsie thought it would be a good one. So
David hopped on the foot of the shake-down
and folded his hands, and wondered how in the
world he was ever going to begin.</p>

<p>“Well, begin,” said Joel impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Well once,” said David, “there was—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Joel, “go on.”</p>

<p>“There was—”</p>

<p>“You said that before.”</p>

<p>“I know it. Well, there was—”</p>

<p>“Stop saying there was,” cried Joel crossly.</p>

<p>“But there really was,” insisted David, feeling
sure that in another moment he should certainly
jump off from the bed, and fly over the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Well, go on. Was what?” roared Joel,
flinging back the comforter.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t do that,” cried David,
sliding along on the bed, still feeling that he
would rather do the tucking up than to tackle
the story. “Mamsie said you must keep the
clothes up,” and he pulled the comforter up
around Joel’s neck.</p>

<p>“Go away,” cried Joel, “and you can’t tell
a story any more than—than—an old hopper-toad.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a hopper-toad,” cried David, a little
pink flush coming over his face.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are, Dave Pepper, a bad old
hopper-toad,” insisted Joel vindictively, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
you don’t know any story, you old hopper-toad,
you!”</p>

<p>David’s face worked dreadfully. “I ain’t—and
I won’t tell you any story.” He got
off from the bed and marched to the stairs.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must,” cried Joel in alarm. A bad
story was better than none. “You promised,
and you’ve got to, or I’ll call Mamsie, and tell
her.” He tossed off the old comforter again.</p>

<p>“Don’t call Mamsie,” cried Davie, hurrying
back.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Joel. Then he snuggled
down in the bed, and drew the long-suffering
bed-clothes up so that only his ears were sticking
out. “Go on.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said David, climbing on the foot of
the bed again and beginning very slowly,
“Once there was—”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that again,” commanded Joel,
sticking up his face from the folds of the comforter.</p>

<p>“A boy,” said David hurriedly.</p>

<p>“How big was he?” asked Joel with faint
interest. But it was just as well to get the
age settled on in the beginning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“Oh, about as big as—” David hesitated.</p>

<p>“Have him as big as me,” said Joel, “and
his arms as big,” he thrust out one, “and his
legs just as exactly as big,” and he stuck out his
foot.</p>

<p>“Oh, get back, Joe,” cried David, frantically
pushing up the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” said Joel, huddling down
again.</p>

<p>“And this boy was going along one day—”</p>

<p>“What was the boy’s name?” asked Joel
suddenly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said David helplessly.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” Joel gave another kick to
the clothes, and snorted, “Hoh!—you’re a
great one, Dave Pepper, to tell a story about a
boy and not know his name.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was—” David floundered helplessly,
“Peter,” he brought out finally.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Joel, quite satisfied.
“Now go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, one day, he was going to school.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t have him go to school,” whined
Joel, dreadfully disappointed that a boy with
such a satisfying name as Peter should waste
time over books. “Make him going to shoot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
something—Go—Bang!” Joel threw up
his arms, and screwed up one eye over an imaginary
gun.</p>

<p>“All right, I will,” said David accommodatingly.
“Well—but you must put in your
arms, Joel.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Joel, huddling back in bed
again, “go on, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Well, so Peter was going to school,
and—”</p>

<p>“No—no,” interrupted Joel, “he was going
out to shoot something; you said so, Dave.”</p>

<p>“So I did,” said Davie. “Well, Peter was
going out to shoot something, and—”</p>

<p>“What was he going to shoot?” demanded
Joel.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Davie helplessly.</p>

<p>“O dear,” grumbled Joel, “you don’t know
any story, and you won’t let Peter do anything,”
and he flounced all over the bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I will—I will,” cried Davie in great
distress. “I’ll let Peter shoot anything you
want—I will truly, Joel.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have a bear,” said Joel, stopping
his tossing about; “no, two bears. Make it
two bears, Dave,” he cried, very much excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“I will,” said David, thinking it just as easy
to deal with two bears, as long as he didn’t
know in the least what to do with one. “Well,
Peter was going to school—I mean out to
shoot something, and he went down the
road—”</p>

<p>“With his gun over his shoulder,” interrupted
Joel.</p>

<p>“Yes, with his gun over his shoulder, and—and
then he turned down the corner.”</p>

<p>“Don’t have any corner,” said Joel, “he
went right straight into the woods, <i>slap bang</i>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said David, “he went into the
woods, and—”</p>

<p>“And have the bear—no, the two bears,
come right now this very minute.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said David, “I will. Well, Peter
went into the woods, and he saw a big tree,
and—”</p>

<p>“<i>Ow!</i> Don’t have any tree,” howled Joel.
“Make a big hole for the bears to live in.”</p>

<p>“I won’t have any tree,” said David.</p>

<p>“Peter heard an awful noise,” and Joel
growled fiercely, “and all of a sudden—gee
whiz! and Peter looked up at a big pile of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
stones—no, let’s have it a cave, an awful big
cave.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s,” said David, leaning forward in
great delight from his post on the foot of the
bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, such a big noise!” and Joel gave another
growl, so much worse than the first that
Davie gave a little scream, and a delightful
shiver ran up and down his small back, as Joel
showed all his little white teeth, “and Peter put
up his gun, for the two bears were looking out
of the cave just like this—” Joel’s black eyes
were simply dreadful, they were so big, and
he bounced up to sit in the middle of the
bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joey,” exclaimed David in great distress,
“do lie down. Mamsie won’t like it— Oh,
Joey!”</p>

<p>“O dear!” Joel tumbled back. “I can’t
shoot the bears lying down.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got to,” said Davie, tucking
him up again, “for Mamsie would feel dreadfully
to have you sit up. Now go on about
the bears.”</p>

<p>“Well, the two bears—no, one bear,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
jumped out of the cave first, and Peter put up
his gun, and <i>Bang!</i> and over went the bear,
and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joey!” cried Davie, in his post again
on the foot of the shake-down, his blue eyes
aflame, “did Peter kill the bear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” said Joel, “just as dead
as dead could be, and the other one, too—oh,
no,” he cried suddenly, “I’m going to have
the other bear chew Peter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Joel,” exclaimed David in horror.
It was bad enough for a boy to be kept from
school and turned into the woods, without being
chewed up by a bear. “Don’t let him,
Joe,” he begged, clasping his hands in great
distress.</p>

<p>“Well, he won’t chew him <i>all</i> up,” said Joel
unwillingly, “only his legs and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let the bear chew Peter’s legs,”
cried David, leaning over close to Joel’s face;
“then Peter can’t run away.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to have Peter run away,”
declared Joel, bobbing his black head decidedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I will, too,” he cried joyfully, and
clapping his hands. “I’ll have the bear chew
him a little on one leg, and then when Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
runs, the bear can chase him, and chew him on
the other, and—”</p>

<p>“Joel,” exclaimed David, with very red
cheeks, “I think that bear is a bad old bear, and
I don’t like him.”</p>

<p>“And then he can chew Peter all up, every
teenty speck,” cried Joel, with sparkling eyes.
“Yes sir!” smacking his lips.</p>

<p>David tumbled quickly off from the bed, and
made for the stairs. “I’m not going to stay
here, if you have Peter chewed up,” he declared,
his blue eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“Dave, don’t go.” Up went Joel’s head
from the pillow, “I won’t let him be chewed
up. You can have that bear for your own.
Don’t go, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Can I have him for my very own?” asked
David, drawing near the bed.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may,” promised Joel, swallowing
hard, “if you’ll come back.”</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t let Peter be chewed up,” said
Davie, clambering on to his old place on the
bed once more, “and I sha’n’t have him shoot
the bear either.”</p>

<p>“What will you do?” cried Joel in great
astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“I’m going to have the bear go right into
his hole again; and Peter is going to school,”
said David with great decision.</p>

<p>“O dear me!” Joel rolled over in terrible
disappointment.</p>

<p>“He’s my bear,” said David, “you gave him
to me, and—”</p>

<p>“Well, Peter isn’t yours,” said Joel, interrupting.
“I’m going to have Peter, so there!”</p>

<p>“You may have the bear, and I’ll take
Peter,” said David eagerly.</p>

<p>“You may. I don’t want Peter—you
won’t let him do anything,” said Joel. “I’d
a great deal rather have the bear,” he brought
up in great satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Well, how nice that is, Davie, for you to
tell Joel a story.” Mother Pepper coming up
the stairs to the loft, beamed approvingly at
him.</p>

<p>David’s cheeks got very hot. “I didn’t tell
the story,” he said, and his face fell.</p>

<p>“He had Peter,” said Joel quickly.</p>

<p>“Joel had two bears, and he told all about
’em,” said David; “I didn’t tell any story,”
he said again in a sorry little voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“And—and—he told about Peter, and
he’s going to school,” Joel brought up with a
wry face.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said Mother Pepper, “I think
that must have been a very good story, and how
nice that you two boys could tell it together.”</p>

<small>ON THE MAYBURY ROAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PHRONSIE crept up to the wood-pile and
peered around it. “Are you sick,
Davie?” she asked in a soft little voice.</p>

<p>David jumped up, tossing the soft waves of
light hair from his forehead. “I’m not sick
a bit,” he said.</p>

<p>“What makes you cry then?” persisted
Phronsie, picking up her pink calico dress to
clamber over the wood.</p>

<p>Davie turned his back and wiped his hot
cheeks.</p>

<p>“I see some tears,” said Phronsie in a distressed
little voice; and stumbling on over the
wood, a big stick slipped down against her toes.</p>

<p>David whirled around. “Don’t come!” he
screamed, making frantic dives over the wood-pile.
Away went two or three sticks, carrying
Phronsie with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>It was all done in a minute, and he had her
out from under them. When he saw the blood
on her little arm, his cheeks went very white,
and his legs wobbled.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get Mamsie,” he said, and
rushed for the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get Mamsie,” wailed Phronsie
after him.</p>

<p>David lent speed to his feet, and burst into
the old kitchen where Polly was brushing up
the floor.</p>

<p>“Phronsie’s hurt!” he screamed. “Do
come, Polly. I’ve spilled wood all over her.”
With that he rushed into the bedroom.
“Mamsie—why where—”</p>

<p>Polly dropped the broom and flew out of
doors, Davie at her heels.</p>

<p>“I can’t find Mamsie,” he panted.</p>

<p>“No, she’s gone to Mrs. Blodgett’s,” Polly
threw over her shoulder as she ran on.
“Where <i>is</i> Phronsie? Oh, Davie, where is
she?”</p>

<p>“By the wood-pile,” gasped David, flying
back of the shed.</p>

<p>But when they both got there, Phronsie was
nowhere to be seen. To find Mamsie was her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
one thought, and since she knew that Mother
Pepper was helping Mrs. Blodgett, why of
course the hurt arm must get there as soon as
possible. So she wiped up her tears on her
small pink apron, and trudged on past the lane
that led to Grandma Bascom’s, and into the
high road.</p>

<p>Polly and David pulled the wood about with
frantic hands, Davie saying all the while, “She
<i>was</i> here. Oh, Polly, she was.”</p>

<p>“Now, David,” Polly seized his arm, “you
must stop saying that for she can’t be under
here. See,” she pointed to the sticks of wood
sprawling about.</p>

<p>“But she <i>was</i> here,” declared David, pawing
wildly in and out among the sticks.</p>

<p>Polly darted off into the shed and hunted
in each corner, calling Phronsie at every step.
Then she ran out to comfort David, and to
keep up the search.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I declare to goodness, John, ef here ain’t a
little girl on th’ road!”</p>

<p>A woman in an old high farm wagon
twitched her husband’s arm. “Do stop an’
take her in. My sakes! ain’t she a mite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
though!” pushing back her big sunbonnet in
order to see the better.</p>

<p>But before the old white horse lumbered up
to the mite, down went Phronsie in a small
heap in the middle of the dusty road.</p>

<p>“John—John!” screamed his wife.
“Stop! You’re a-runnin’ over her!”</p>

<p>“Land o’ Goshen! ain’t I stoppin’?” roared
her husband at her. The old horse almost sat
down on his tired haunches at the sudden
twitch on the reins. Then the farmer leaned
forward and stared ahead down the road.</p>

<p>“Ef you ain’t goin’ to git out an’ pick up
that child, I am, John Brown. Sech a mortal
slow man I never see,” snorted his wife scornfully.</p>

<p>“An’ sech a flutter-budget as you be, no man
ever saw,” Mr. Brown found time to say as he
got slowly down over the wheel.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s got to flutter-budget in this
world,” said his wife after him, as he walked
slowly over to the small pink heap, “or everybody’d
go to sleep. Bring her to me, John.— Oh,
do hurry! Bring her to me!”</p>

<p>“I want Mamsie,” said Phronsie, as Mr.
Brown leaned over her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“Hey?” said the farmer, bringing his rough
face with its stubby beard close to her little one.</p>

<p>“I’m going to my Mamsie,” said Phronsie,
her blue eyes searching his face, “and my foots
are tired.” With that she put up her arms.</p>

<p>“I’ll be blowed!” exclaimed Mr. Brown.
Then he saw the little blood-stained arm and he
started back.</p>

<p>“Take me,” said Phronsie, as she clutched
his shaggy coat, “please, to my Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you git hurt?” asked Mr. Brown,
with no eyes for anything but the small arm
with its bloody streak.</p>

<p>Phronsie looked down and surveyed it
gravely. “My Mamsie will make it well,” she
said confidently.</p>

<p>“John—John!” screamed his wife, from
the high wagon, “are you goin’ to stay all day
with that child in th’ middle of the road, or do
you want me to come an’ look after her?”</p>

<p>“You stay where you be, Nancy,” said Mr.
Brown. “I don’t know no more’n th’ last
one,” this to Phronsie, “where ’tis you want to
go to. But I’ll take you there, all th’ same.
Now, says I, hold tight, little un.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Phronsie in a satisfied little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
voice, putting her arms around his neck. So
he bundled her up in his great arms and
marched to the high wagon.</p>

<p>“Give her to me,” cried his wife, hungrily
extending her hands.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t ef I didn’t have to drive,” said
Mr. Brown, as he clumsily set Phronsie on the
broad lap. “She’s hurt her arm. Be careful,
Mother,” as he got into the wagon and
began to drive off.</p>

<p>“My soul an’ body!” exclaimed Mrs.
Brown, pausing in the hugging process now set
up, to regard the little bloody arm. “Oh,
how’d you get that?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to my mamsie,” announced
Phronsie joyfully, and ignoring the injured
arm. Then she laughed, showing all her little
teeth, and snuggled against Mrs. Brown’s big
shawl.</p>

<p>“Ain’t she too cunnin’ for anythin’!” exclaimed
Mrs. Brown. “Did you ever see th’
like? But how’d you git hurt?” she demanded,
turning to Phronsie again.</p>

<p>“It was the wood,” said Phronsie, gravely
regarding her arm again. “And I’m going to
Mamsie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“She keeps a-sayin’ that,” said Mr. Brown.
“Now, how in thunder will we know where
to take her?”</p>

<p>“Don’t swear,” said his wife.</p>

<p>“‘Thunder’ ain’t swearin’,” retorted Mr.
Brown with a virtuous air. “I c’d say lots
worse things.”</p>

<p>“Well, git out and say ’em in th’ road, then,”
advised his wife, “an’ not before this child.
Where’d you say you was a-goin’?” She
bent her large face over the small one snuggled
against her ample bosom.</p>

<p>“To my Mamsie,” said Phronsie, so glad
that at last she was understood.</p>

<p>The wrinkles in Farmer Brown’s face ran
clear down to his stubby beard, as he slapped
one hard hand on his knee.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—yes,” said his wife, nodding her
big sunbonnet.</p>

<p>“Don’t pretend you understand her,
Mother,” Mr. Brown turned to his wife, “for
you don’t—neither of us do, no more’n th’
dead.”</p>

<p>“You let me be, John,” said Mrs. Brown,
“an’ I’ll attend to this child.”</p>

<p>Farmer Brown whistled and looked off up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
the clouds; perhaps something might come
down to illuminate the situation.</p>

<p>“Now, where is Mum—Mam—whatever
you said?” began Mrs. Brown, patting Phronsie’s
yellow hair with a large red hand.</p>

<p>“Off there.” Phronsie pointed a small finger
off into space.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Mrs. Brown, nodding her sunbonnet
again. The puckers were beginning to
come in her face. Mr. Brown, taking his gaze
off from the clouds, looked at her and grinned.</p>

<p>“Well, now let’s see,” said Mrs. Brown reflectively,
and with a cold shoulder for the
farmer; “Mamsie—”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Phronsie gave another little laugh
and wriggled her feet. It was so lovely that
they understood her; and she was really on the
way to her Mamsie.</p>

<p>“Let’s see—now what road did you say
you want to go to git to this—Mamsie?”
began the farmer’s wife, smiling encouragingly
at her.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know?” Phronsie lifted
her head suddenly to gaze into Mrs. Brown’s
face. “Off there.” Again she pointed to
space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“You keep still.” Mrs. Brown thrust her
elbow into the farmer’s side, as she saw his
mouth open. “You’re more care than th’
child. I’ll find out—you keep still!”</p>

<p>“<i>Hem!</i>” said Mr. Brown loudly.</p>

<p>“And please have us get to Mamsie soon,”
begged Phronsie, beginning to look worried.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” Mrs. Brown promised quickly.
“Well, now let’s see—how does Mamsie
look?” she began.</p>

<p>“Why, she’s my Mamsie, and—”</p>

<p>“<i>She?</i>” screamed the farmer’s wife. “Oh,
my soul an’ body! I thought ’twas a house.”</p>

<p>“Thunder!” ejaculated Mr. Brown; “now
we’re in a fix, ef it’s a woman. Th’ Lord
knows how we’ll ever find her.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you come from?” Mrs. Brown
now found it impossible to keep the anxiety
from running all up and down her big face.
Phronsie put up her trembling little lips and
pointed off, still into space.</p>

<p>“John,” his wife burst out, “we <i>are</i> in a fix,
an’ that’s th’ solemn truth.”</p>

<p>The farmer took off his old cap and scratched
his head. “Well, anyway, we’ve got th’ little
gal, an’ you’ve always wanted one, Nancy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Ef we can only keep her.” Mrs. Brown
hugged Phronsie hungrily to her breast. “Oh,
my little lamb!” she kept saying.</p>

<p>“I want my Mamsie!” said Phronsie,
nearly smothered. “<i>Please</i> take me to my
Mamsie!” and she struggled to get free.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to go to a nice house?”
began the farmer’s wife in a wheedling way,
as she set her upon her knees.</p>

<p>“There—there.” Mr. Brown whipped out
a big red handkerchief and wiped off the tears
from the little face. “Ma, she’s a-cryin’,” he
announced in an awful voice.</p>

<p>“There are chickens,” said Mrs. Brown desperately,
“and—”</p>

<p>“Are there little chickies?” asked Phronsie,
as Mr. Brown gave her face another dab with
the big handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, awful little ones,” cried Mrs.
Brown; “just as little as anythin’, an’ yellow
an’ white an’ fluffy.”</p>

<p>Phronsie clapped her hands and smiled between
her tears.</p>

<p>“An’ there’s pigs, little ones,” broke in the
farmer, to hold all advantage gained, “an’ you
can scratch their backs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Phronsie tore off her thoughts from the little
chickens, yellow and white and fluffy, to regard
the farmer. “<i>Ooh!</i> I want to see the little
pigs,” she cried, leaning over to look into Mr.
Brown’s face, “and I’m going to scratch their
backs right off.”</p>

<p>“So you shall—so you shall,” he cried,
“when you get to my house.”</p>

<p>Phronsie’s lip fell suddenly, and she flew
back to Mrs. Brown’s arms. “I want to go to
the little brown house,” she wailed, casting herself
up against the kind breast.</p>

<p>“John, can’t you let well enough alone?”
scolded his wife. “She was took with the
chickens. There, there, child, don’t cry.”</p>

<p>“She liked my pigs best,” said the farmer
sullenly. “G’long there!” slapping the leather
reins down smartly on the back of the old white
horse.</p>

<p>“I want to go to the little brown house,”
Phronsie wailed steadily on.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s where you’re goin’,” said the
farmer. He turned suddenly. “That’s jest
where we’re a-takin’ you to, the Brown house.”</p>

<p>“Are you?” cried Phronsie, her wails stopping
suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“<i>Sure</i>,” said Mr. Brown decidedly. “Now,
Ma, we’ll take her home with us. We’ll inquire
all along th’ road ef anybody knows who
she is,” he said in a low voice over Phronsie’s
head. “She’ll be all right when she sees them
pigs an’ chickens.”</p>

<p>“An’ ef we can’t find where she b’longs,
why, we’ll adopt her, an’ she’ll be ours,” finished
his wife, all in a tremble. “Oh, you
sweet lamb, you!” She kissed Phronsie’s yellow
head.</p>

<p>Phronsie, quite contented now that she was
on the way to the little brown house where
Polly was and Mamsie would soon come, presently
began to hum in a happy little voice, and
the old white horse and big high wagon went
jogging on over a short cross-road leading to
Maybury, where the farmer and his good wife
lived.</p>

<p>Meantime Polly and Davie were having a
perfectly dreadful time searching everywhere,
even turning an old barrel, afraid that Phronsie
had pulled it over on herself, and scouring
every inch of the ground around the little
brown house. Then Davie dashed off at
top speed, down over the lane leading to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Grandma Bascom’s, sure of finding Phronsie
there.</p>

<p>But Grandma, feeding her hens from a tin
pan of potato and apple parings, shook her cap
hard when Davie stood on his tiptoes and
screamed into her ear all about Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Oh, the pretty creeter!” she mourned, and
the pan in her hands shook so that it fell to
the ground, and the hens clattered around and
scratched and fought till every bit of the potato
and apple skins was gobbled up.</p>

<p>Davie rushed off from the tangle of hens
about Grandma’s feet, with only one thought—to
get to Deacon Blodgett’s as fast as he
could. And flying down the lane, he ran into
the main road, just after the old white horse
and big high wagon had turned the corner leading
to Maybury, carrying Phronsie off to the
Brown house.</p>

<p>“Whoa—there—Great Saint Peter!”
shouted somebody at him. Davie was so blind
with the drops of perspiration running down
his face that he couldn’t see, and besides, by
that time his small legs were so used to running
that they kept on, even after the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
man in the top buggy had pulled up in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you ever goin’ to stop?” roared the
young man, leaning out of the buggy and staring
at him.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” panted Davie, pausing a moment.</p>

<p>“What’s th’ matter? Goin’ for th’ doctor?”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ for Mamsie,” said Davie, rushing
on.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Who you’re goin’ for?” roared
the young man.</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” panted Davie, whirling around.</p>

<p>“I d’no what in th’ blazes that is,” the young
man took off his cap and scratched his head.
“Well, what are you goin’ for, lickety-split like
that! Come here, you boy!”</p>

<p>Davie came slowly up to the side of the
buggy. Somehow a note of hope began to sing
in his small heart that maybe the young man
might help.</p>

<p>“I let my sister get wood spilled all over
her,” he said, his face working dreadfully,
“and she’s lost, an’ I’m going to Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“I can’t make head nor tail of it at all,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the young man. Then he put on his cap, since
scratching his head did no good. “Well, your
sister’s lost, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Davie, hanging to the wheel.
“Oh, have you seen her, Mr. Man? She had
on a pink dress—”</p>

<p>“Hey? Oh, thunder an’ lightnin’!” he
slapped his knee, with a red hand, “was she a
little gal?”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” cried Davie, with wide blue
eyes. “Oh, <i>have</i> you seen her, Mr. Man?”</p>

<p>“I think likely,” said the young man, bending
over till his face nearly touched Davie’s hot
cheek, “an’ then again, mebbe I hain’t. I’ve
seen a little gal in a pink dress, but she may not
be your sister. How big was she?”</p>

<p>Davie released his clutch on the wheel, to
bend down and measure where Phronsie’s head
would come if she stood there in the road before
him, the young man leaning out to critically
watch the proceeding.</p>

<p>“I b’lieve as sure as shootin’, that’s th’ little
gal.” Then he whistled and slapped his knee
again.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Man, help me to find her!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Davie grasped the wheel once more and held on
for dear life.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t as long as you hang on to that
’ere wheel,” said the young man. “Now you
hop in, and I’ll catch up with that young one in
three shakes of a lamb’s tail.”</p>

<p>Over the wheel went Davie, to sink down in
a small heap on the old leather seat.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—ee!” declared the young man
again. “I seen her in Mis Brown’s lap as sure
as shootin’. It’s lucky she’s fell in such good
hands. Well, I’ll catch up with that old white
plug of a horse. G’lang!” He whipped up,
passing the turn in the road where Phronsie
was being carried off in the high wagon on the
“short cut” to the Brown house in Maybury.</p>

<small>BACK TO MAMSIE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“TH’ beef’s biled ’mos’ to nothin’,” said
Mrs. Brown, sticking a long iron fork
into the pot of corned beef, surrounded by
bubbling heaps of cabbage. She had thrown
off her sunbonnet on the old sofa in the sitting-room,
and hurried into the bedroom where she
had deposited Phronsie, fast asleep, on the gay
patched bedquilt.</p>

<p>“There, you sweet lamb, you!” Then she
hurried out to see about the belated dinner.</p>

<p>“John,” she called, as she ran out to the
barn, “come, dinner’s ready.”</p>

<p>Farmer Brown turned as he was leading the
old white horse to his stall. “Is she awake?”
pointing with his thumb to the house.</p>

<p>“No,” Mrs. Brown sped back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“What’ll we do with that little gal?” the
farmer’s face puckered all up with dismay as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
reflected: “Nobody on th’ road knows th’ fust
thing about her, an’ I s’pose her Ma’s cryin’
her eyes out.” He slouched up to the kitchen
door.</p>

<p>“I thought you was never comin’”; his wife
set the big blue platter with the corned beef and
its generous fringe of cabbage on the table;
then down went the dish of potatoes and the
loaf of bread. “Th’ beef’s all biled to pieces,”
she said, getting into her chair.</p>

<p>“What beats me,” said Mr. Brown, sitting
down heavily, and taking up the horn-handled
carving knife and fork, “is, what are we to do
with her.” He pointed with carving knife to
the bedroom.</p>

<p>“I d’no,” said his wife; “do help out that
beef. It’s all biled to death,” passing her plate.</p>

<p>“It will eat just as good,” said the farmer,
cutting off a scraggy strip, and dishing up a
generous spoonful of cabbage to go with it to
the waiting plate. “Well, Nancy, I’m beat to
know what we’re goin’ to do with her.”</p>

<p>“Do stop talkin’ about her,” cried his wife.
“She’s asleep now. And I’m as nervous as a
witch.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose we might as well eat,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
farmer, helping himself liberally. “Mebbe we
can decide what to do better after we have eat.”</p>

<p>“I can’t think why I didn’t set that pot clear
back on the stove,” said Mrs. Brown in vexation.
“I might ’a’ known ’twould bile too fast
when we went to Badgertown. I didn’t s’pose
we’d be gone so long.”</p>

<p>“Well, ef we’d got home sooner we wouldn’t
’a’ come up with the little gal,” observed the
farmer philosophically, while his portion of
beef and cabbage was going rapidly to its
last resting-place.</p>

<p>“What good will it do that we found her?”
said his wife discontentedly. “We’ve got to
give her up.”</p>

<p>“Well, I s’pose so,” said Mr. Brown slowly.
“Hem! Ain’t I ever goin’ to have no tea?”
he asked in an injured voice, looking hard
across at his wife.</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy!” Mrs. Brown hopped out of
her chair. “I don’t wonder that I forgot th’
teapot. Th’ Angel Gabriel couldn’t never remember
anythin’ on sech a mornin’ as we’ve
had!” She whipped her husband’s big blue
cup off from the dresser, bringing it back full
and steaming hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“I guess th’ Angel Gabriel hain’t ever had
much to do with tea,” said Mr. Brown, putting
in a good spoonful of brown sugar, and all the
cream that would get safely into the cup; “he’s
got enough to do a-blowin’ that horn o’ his’n.
Well, don’t worry, Ma. Do set down an’ take
it easy. Th’ little gal hain’t got to go yet.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to start after dinner about
it.” Mrs. Brown played nervously with her
knife and fork. Then she threw them down
on her plate, jumped up and turned her back on
the farmer, dinner and all.</p>

<p>“My soul an’ body!” cried Mr. Brown, his
knife half-way to his mouth. He stopped to
stare aghast at her. “You hain’t never acted
like this, Nancy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hain’t never had nothin’ like this to
set me goin’,” said Nancy, her voice trembling.
“To think that child should ’a’ sprung up to-day,
an’ I’ve always wanted a little gal—”</p>

<p>Farmer Brown shook all over. Down fell
the knife to the kitchen floor. He glared all
around the big kitchen as if somehow that were
to blame. Then he cleared his throat two or
three times. “P’raps they’ll let us keep her,
Nancy,” he managed to get out at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>But Nancy, sobbing in her apron, was beyond
the sound of comfort.</p>

<p>“You know as well as you set in that chair
that they won’t,” she sobbed. “O dear, why
did we find her—and I want a little gal so!”</p>

<p>“<i>Hush!</i>—somebody’s comin’,” warned the
farmer. Round the corner of the house came
two figures, and pretty soon “<i>Rap—Rap!</i>” on
the old door.</p>

<p>“Set down, Nancy!” cried her husband;
“for goodness sake, all Maybury will think you
an’ me’s ben quarreling!”</p>

<p>“They couldn’t think that, John,” cried Mrs.
Brown in dismay, and hurried back to the dinner
table.</p>

<p>“When they see you a-cryin’, you can’t tell
what they’d think,” said the farmer grimly, and
taking his time about opening the door.</p>

<p>“I ain’t cryin’,” said his wife, wiping all
traces of the tears from her large face, and
sitting very straight in her chair, as she got her
company face on.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mr. Brown flung wide the big
door. “How do, Hubbard.” Then his eye
fell on a very small boy with big blue eyes, who
was crowding up anxiously, and, not waiting to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
be invited, was already in the kitchen and staring
around.</p>

<p>“You must ’xcuse him,” said Young Hubbard,
“he’s lost his sister.”</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife jumped out of her chair,
and seized the boy’s arm. “We’ve got her,”
she said; “don’t look so; she’s all safe here.”</p>

<p>“I must take her to Mamsie,” said Davie,
lifting his white face.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” said Mrs. Brown, while the
old farmer and the young one stood by silently.
“You come in here, an’ see for yourself how
safe she is.”</p>

<p>Davie rushed into the bedroom and gave one
bound over to the big bed. Phronsie was just
getting up to the middle of it, and wiping her
eyes. When she saw Davie she gave a little
crow of delight. “I’m going to Mamsie,” she
announced, as she threw her arms around him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Davie, staggering off with her
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“You’re goin’ to have your dinner first,”
said the farmer’s wife in alarm. “Gracious
me—th’ very idea of goin’ without a bite,” she
added, bustling about for more dishes and
knives and forks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“We can’t,” said Davie, struggling along to
the door. “I must get her to Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“Young man,” roared Farmer Brown at
him. “You set down to that table. Now,
Ma, dish up some hot meat an’ taters.”</p>

<p>“And a glass of milk,” said Mrs. Brown,
hurrying into the pantry.</p>

<p>“I want some milk,” cried Phronsie,
hungrily stretching out her arms. So before
David hardly knew how, there she was sitting
on the big family Bible that Mr. Brown placed
on one of the chairs, before the dinner table.
When she saw it was really and truly milk
with a frothy top, she was quite overcome and
sat looking at it.</p>

<p>“Drink it, little gal,” said Farmer Brown,
with a hand on her yellow hair.</p>

<p>Phronsie laughed a pleased little gurgle, and
set her small teeth on the edge of the mug,
drinking as fast as she could.</p>

<p>“Hulloa—hold up a bit,” said the farmer,
with a big hand on her arm. Phronsie’s blue
eyes over the cup-edge turned on him inquiringly.
“Go slower, little gal.” Mr. Brown
took the mug and set it on the table. “Th’
milk will wait for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“It is nice,” said Phronsie, beaming delightedly
at him.</p>

<p>“So ’tis,” said the farmer, wiping off the
milk streaks from her face. “An’ you shall
have th’ rest by an’ by.”</p>

<p>“Shall I?” asked Phronsie, looking at the
mug affectionately.</p>

<p>“<i>Sure</i>,” declared Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>Meantime the farmer’s wife was having a
perfectly dreadful time with David, who stood
impatiently off by the door, his hand on the
latch.</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sakes!” she exclaimed, “do
you set down an’ eat dinner, Jed,” to the young
farmer, “an’ p’raps th’ boy will listen to reason
an’ eat some too.”</p>

<p>“Now see here, young man,” Farmer Brown
stalked over to David, as Jed Hubbard, nothing
loath, slipped into his chair to tackle the
corned beef and cabbage, “how d’ye s’pose
you’re goin’ to git that little gal to your Ma—hey?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to carry her,” said David, “and
we must go.” He clasped his hands and turned
a pleading face up to the farmer.</p>

<p>“You carry her?” repeated the farmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“Hoh—Hoh!” he threw back his head and
laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t laugh at him, Pa,” begged Mrs.
Brown, piling on more food to Farmer Hubbard’s
plate; “he’s awful distressed,” as Davie
begged, “Do let us go—Mamsie will—”</p>

<p>“You’re a-goin’,” Mr. Brown interrupted;
“I shall take you an’ th’ leetle gal in th’ wagon,
as soon as you’ve et somethin’.”</p>

<p>“Will you really take us to Mamsie?” cried
Davie, the color coming quickly into his white
cheeks.</p>

<p>“<i>Sure</i>,” promised the farmer heartily, as
David flew into the chair that Mrs. Brown had
dragged up to the table.</p>

<p>“Now get him a good plateful, Ma,” said the
farmer, getting into his own chair. “Land—I
hain’t worked so hard for many a day— Whew!”</p>

<p>But although David had a “good plateful”
before him, it was impossible for him to eat to
the satisfaction of the good people, as he turned
anxious eyes upon Farmer Brown and then to
the door.</p>

<p>“I don’t b’lieve he’ll swaller enough to keep
a crow alive,” said Mrs. Brown in dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Pa, wouldn’t it be best to do up some vittles
in a paper, an’ he can eat on the way.”</p>

<p>“I’ve come to the conclusion it would,” said
her husband grimly.</p>

<p>“An’ I’ll put in some cookies for th’ little
gal,” said his wife, darting into the pantry to
the big stone jar.</p>

<p>“An’ I’ll harness up,” said Mr. Brown, going
to the big door.</p>

<p>The young farmer looked up from his dinner.
“You better take my horse, Mr. Brown,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Kin you spare her?”</p>

<p>“Yes—an’ take th’ buggy too. You can
have it all as easy as anything. You an’ me
are such close neighbors, I can come over an’
git it to-night.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s real kind,” said Farmer Brown,
going out.</p>

<p>“Th’ buggy?” repeated Mrs. Brown, coming
out of the pantry with the bundle of cookies.
“Well, I’m goin’, too, Jed. I don’t b’lieve
there’s room for us all to set comfortable.”</p>

<p>Jedediah looked her all over. “’Twill be a
close fit, maybe, but the wagon’s so heavy.
Must you go, Mis Brown?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Jedediah Hubbard,” Mrs. Brown set down
the cookies on the table, and looked at him
hard. “I ain’t a-goin’ to give up that little gal
a minute sooner’n I’ve got to,” she said decidedly.
“An’ I’m goin’ to see her Ma.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mrs. Brown,” and Jedediah returned
to his dinner.</p>

<p>But when the starting off arrived, there was
a pretty bad time—Farmer Brown protesting
there wasn’t “enough room to squeeze a cat in.”
Mrs. Brown ended the matter by saying “There
ain’t goin’ to be no cat,” and getting in she
established herself, Phronsie on her lap, on one
half of the leather seat of the top buggy.</p>

<p>“Where’s the boy goin’ to set?” demanded
her husband, looking at her.</p>

<p>“I d’no about that,” said his wife, wrapping
her shawl carefully around Phronsie. “Yes,
you can carry the cookies, child. Men folks
must look out for themselves,” she said coolly.</p>

<p>“It’s all very well for you to set there an’
tell me that,” said Farmer Brown in a disgruntled
way, as he got in over the wheel, “but
then, you’re a woman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m a woman,” said Mrs. Brown composedly.
“Oh, th’ boy can set on a stool in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
front. Jed, just bring out that little cricket
from th’ settin’-room, will you?”</p>

<p>David, with the paper bag containing slices
of corned beef between pieces of bread, not
caring where he sat so long as he was on the
way with Phronsie to Mamsie, settled down on
the cricket that young Mr. Hubbard brought.
Then he looked up into the young farmer’s face.
“Good-by,” he said, “and thank you for bringing
me here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good-by, youngster,” said Jedediah,
wringing a hand that tingled most of the way
home. “Well, I hope to run across you again
some time. If you ever lose your sister, you
just call on me.”</p>

<p>“We aren’t ever going to lose Phronsie,”
declared David, bobbing his head solemnly, as
the top buggy and the young farmer’s horse
moved off.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown didn’t utter a word all the way
to Badgertown except “How d’ye s’pose Jedediah
ever found that we had the little gal?”</p>

<p>“Let Jed Hubbard alone for findin’ out anythin’,”
said Farmer Brown. He was so occupied
in gazing at Phronsie, carefully eating
around the edge of each cooky before enjoying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the whole of it, that the smart young horse
went pretty much as he pleased. Finally Mr.
Brown looked down at Davie on his cricket.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you ever goin’ to eat your dinner,
young man?” he said. “Ef you don’t we’ll
turn an’ go back again,” he added severely.</p>

<p>“Oh, I will—I will,” cried Davie, who had
forgotten all about his dinner in his efforts to
measure the distance being overcome on the
way home to Mamsie. And he unrolled the
paper bundle.</p>

<p>When it was all exposed to view, the corned
beef smelt so good that he set his teeth in it, and
gave a sigh of delight.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown winked across to his wife
over Davie’s head and presently the bread, and
even a cold potato well sprinkled with salt, disappeared,
and only the empty paper lay in
Davie’s lap.</p>

<p>“Throw it out in th’ road,” said Farmer
Brown, well satisfied that the dinner was at last
where it should be.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” said David, holding the paper
fast.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no good—throw it out, boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Mamsie wouldn’t like me to throw papers
in the road. It scares horses.”</p>

<p>“Sho—now!” Farmer Brown pushed up
his cap and scratched his head. “I guess your
Ma’s all right,” at last he said.</p>

<p>When the little brown house popped into
view, David flew around on his cricket excitedly.
“There ’tis—it’s there!”</p>

<p>“I see it,” said Farmer Brown. “Set still—we’ll
be there in a minute.”</p>

<p>“It’s my little brown house,” cried Phronsie,
trying to slip out from Mrs. Brown’s lap.</p>

<p>“Oh, you lamb—do wait. Little gal, we’ll
take you there in a minute. Set still, child.”</p>

<p>“And I see Mamsie—oh, I want my Mamsie!”
cried Phronsie, struggling worse than
ever, her little legs flying in her efforts to be
free.</p>

<p>David stood straight, his head knocking the
buggy top. “Polly, we’re coming!” he
shouted.</p>

<p>“Hold on—don’t you jump!” roared the
farmer, catching his jacket, as Polly dashed up
to the buggy and ran along by its side, the
brown waves of hair flying over her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Mamsie!” called Phronsie, leaning as far
as she could from Mrs. Brown’s lap, “see my
arm,” as Mrs. Pepper drew near, and she held
it up with its bandage soaked in opodeldoc that
the farmer’s wife had tied on.</p>

<p>“<i>Whoa!</i>” Farmer Brown brought the
Hubbard horse up with a smart jerk. “You
might as well git out here,” he said, “for I’ll
never keep you two in this buggy till we git to
th’ house.”</p>

<p>“I never can thank you,” Mother Pepper
was saying, as the farmer’s wife got heavily
out of the buggy, “for all your goodness.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown’s mouth worked and she tried
to speak. “I wish—” she looked off to the
little brown house, but she couldn’t finish what
she had been composing all the way along—“you’d
let me have this little gal for a while,
anyway; you’ve got so many children; and I
haven’t got one.” So she only kept on wobbling
her lips and twisting her hands.</p>

<p>“<i>Hem!</i>” Farmer Brown cleared his throat.
“I’ll come over an’ git them two,” pointing a
rugged forefinger in the direction of Davie and
Phronsie, “ef you’ll let ’em come over an’ pass
th’ day with us some time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“He’s got chickies,” said Phronsie, raising
her head from Mrs. Pepper’s arms.</p>

<p>“And pigs,” said Farmer Brown, “little uns—don’t
you forgit them.”</p>

<p>“And dear sweet little pigs—oh, Mamsie,
and I am going to scratch their backs.”</p>

<p>“An’,” Farmer Brown whirled around on
David, “this young man’s comin’, <i>sure</i>! He’s
a right smart boy, an’ I’ve took a fancy to him.”</p>

<p>“They shall go,” said Mrs. Pepper, with a
bright smile. “And Phronsie will never forget
you, dear Mrs. —”</p>

<p>“Brown,” said the farmer promptly, seeing
his wife couldn’t speak.</p>

<p>“No, she will never forget you, dear Mrs.
Brown.” Mother Pepper got hold of the big
hand, twisting its mate.</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife clutched it. “You see
I always wanted a little gal,” she whispered
close to Mrs. Pepper’s ear.</p>

<p>Then Mother Pepper did a thing the children
had never seen before. She leaned forward
and kissed the large face.</p>

<p>“We must be goin’,” declared Farmer
Brown, whipping out his big red handkerchief
to blow his nose loudly. “<i>Hem!</i> Come, Ma.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Did Mamsie cry when we didn’t come
home?” asked David anxiously, as they all
filed off toward the little brown house.</p>

<p>“No. Oh, I’m so sorry you worried,
Davie,” cried Polly. “You see I ran down to
Deacon Blodgett’s to tell Mamsie, and Mr. Atkins
saw me go by, and he called out that a
Mr. Hubbard had you in that very buggy you
came home in.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did,” said David.</p>

<p>“And he said he knew you were going after
Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we did,” said David.</p>

<p>“And then he told us that a man in the store
said that some folks over at Maybury—real
good folks, had Phronsie in their wagon,
and—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said David, “they did.”</p>

<p>“So we knew everything was all right,”
Polly ran on gayly, “and Mamsie said all we
had to do was to wait patiently, and not stir
Ben and Joel up where they were at work in
Deacon Blodgett’s south meadow, so—”</p>

<p>“Polly,” cried Davie excitedly, as they ran
into the little brown house, “I like that big Mr.
Brown very much indeed.”</p>

<small>“GOOD-BY, CHILDREN”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">“I MUSTN’T cry again,” said David to himself
the next morning. He stopped a
minute picking up the chips, before he threw
them into the old basket. “Maybe I’ll get to
school some time and learn things.”</p>

<p>Then he threw the chips into the basket until
it was full enough to empty into the wood-box
behind the old stove in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” cried Joel, rushing in at dinner-time,
“’twasn’t any fun piling wood at Deacon
Blodgett’s without Dave.”</p>

<p>“Davie can’t pile wood to-day, Joel,” said
Mrs. Pepper, “he had such a hard time yesterday
going after Phronsie.” She glanced over
at him affectionately, as she went into the pantry
for the cold potatoes to fry.</p>

<p>David began eagerly, “Oh, Mamsie—” then
he stopped when he saw her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“O dear,” grumbled Joel. “It’s awful hard
work piling wood without Dave. Isn’t dinner
ready?” he asked, impatiently.</p>

<p>“It will be in a few minutes,” said Mrs. Pepper,
slicing the potatoes over by the table.
“See, Joey, I’m going to give you fried potatoes
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody!” exclaimed Joel, rushing over
to the table and smacking his lips. “See,
Dave, fried potatoes!”</p>

<p>David tried to smile as he turned off.</p>

<p>“And I shall fry them brown,” said Mrs.
Pepper, cutting the last potato into thin strips.</p>

<p>“She’s going to fry ’em brown,” announced
Joel in great excitement, and running over to
pull David’s jacket, “real crispy brown, so
they’ll crack in your teeth. Won’t you, Mamsie,—really
crispy, cracksy brown,” deserting
David to rush over to the table again.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Pepper, smiling at him, as
she went over to the stove to set on the frying-pan.
“Where’s Ben? It’s time that he was
here.”</p>

<p>“I forgot,” said Joel, a flush spreading over
his round cheeks; “Deacon Blodgett said Ben
wouldn’t come home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>Mother Pepper paused with the frying-pan
in her hand. “Did Deacon Blodgett say
why?”</p>

<p>“They’re going to take something to eat in
a basket,” said Joel, beginning to look very injured,
“and they wouldn’t take me. They told
me to run home and tell you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joey, and you forgot a message,” said
Mrs. Pepper reprovingly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to,” said Joel, hanging his
head.</p>

<p>“Didn’t mean to, doesn’t excuse such a
thing,” said Mrs. Pepper. Then she set the
frying-pan at the back of the stove and stood
quite still.</p>

<p>“Mamsie—I didn’t,” cried Joel, running
over to hide his head in her gown, “I truly
didn’t,” he howled.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t mean to,” echoed David,
drawing near in great distress.</p>

<p>“I know, Davie,” said Mrs. Pepper, stroking
Joel’s stubby black hair as he burrowed in her
gown, “but it is a very bad thing to forget a
message.”</p>

<p>“I won’t ever do it again,” whimpered Joel,
his brown hands holding fast to her gown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“I hope not, Joel.” Then she glanced over
at the thin slices in the dish on the table. “Ben
does like fried potatoes so much! That’s the
reason I was going to have them to-day.”</p>

<p>“He can have mine,” said Joel, twitching
his head away from Mother Pepper’s gown,
and not looking at the potato-dish, for his
mouth watered dreadfully.</p>

<p>“And give him mine,” said Davie, hurrying
over to Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“No, children, there is enough for all, and
I will fry some for Ben at another time. Run
down and see if Polly and Phronsie are coming
from the store.”</p>

<p>“O dear, my legs are tired,” said Joel crossly,
and tumbling on the kitchen floor, he waved
them in the air.</p>

<p>“I’ll go—I’ll go,” said Davie, running to
get his cap.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mother Pepper. “You are not
to go, Davie.”</p>

<p>“Dave wants to go,” said Joel, rolling over
to look at her with his black eyes.</p>

<p>“Davie is very tired since yesterday,” said
Mrs. Pepper. “Get up, Joel, and go to the
gate at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Polly’s always late,” grumbled Joel, getting
up to his feet.</p>

<p>“Polly is never late,” said David stoutly.
“She’s always and ever here,” and his face
got very red.</p>

<p>“There—there, boys,” said Mrs. Pepper.
“Run along, Joel.”</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” David ran over to her, as the big
green door banged, “I’m not tired. Please let
me help about things.”</p>

<p>“You must be tired, Davie,” Mrs. Pepper
beamed affectionately at him, “and it won’t do
for you to run your legs off for I depend so
much on you.”</p>

<p>David looked down at his legs. Then he
straightened up. “Do you really depend on
me, Mamsie?” and the color ran all over his
little cheeks.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do,” said Mother Pepper heartily.
Then she glanced up at the clock. “Polly and
Phronsie ought to be here.”</p>

<p>“They’re coming,” shouted Davie gleefully,
and rushing to the big green door, he swung it
wide. In jumped Joel, swinging the molasses
jug, and after him Polly and Phronsie.</p>

<p>“<i>Whoop!</i>” screamed Joel, “isn’t dinner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
ready? We’re going to have fried potatoes,”
he announced to Polly.</p>

<p>“Fried potatoes!” exclaimed Polly in astonishment.
Then she ran over to the old stove.
“Oh, Mamsie, <i>fried potatoes</i>!” wrinkling up
her nose at the sizzling in the old frying-pan.</p>

<p>“I like it,” said Phronsie, clutching a little
paper bag; “let me smell it, Polly, do!” standing
on her tiptoes.</p>

<p>“I thought Ben was coming home to dinner,
and he does so like fried potatoes,” said Mrs.
Pepper in a low voice, as she turned the slices.</p>

<p>“Isn’t Ben coming to dinner?” asked Polly.</p>

<p>“No—hush, Polly!” with a glance over at
Joel, coming out from the pantry where he had
put the molasses jug. “Ben’s gone somewhere
with Deacon Blodgett. Now hurry and get on
Phronsie’s eating-apron.”</p>

<p>“Joel was awfully good—he took the molasses
jug from me,” said Polly, tying on
Phronsie’s checked eating-apron.</p>

<p>“I’m glad he thought to do it,” said Mother
Pepper, with a smile. “Now sit down, children,
the potatoes are done.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Atkins gave Phronsie a whole lot
of peppermints,” said Polly, when the meal was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
half over, and the plates were scraped clean
from all trace of potato slices.</p>

<p>“Yes, he did,” said Phronsie, bobbing her
yellow head, and taking off her gaze from the
dish where the delightfully brown crackly
things had been. When she had been obliged
to relinquish her little paper bag, after the eating
apron was on, she had insisted that it should
be kept in her lap. So now she patted it lovingly.</p>

<p>“<i>Oo!</i> Peppermints!” screamed Joel.
“Let’s see, Phronsie,” and he hopped out of his
seat.</p>

<p>“No, no, Joey,” reproved Mother Pepper.</p>

<p>“She said peppermints,” said Joel, slipping
into his chair.</p>

<p>“I will give you some,” said Phronsie, with
another little pat on the paper bag, “and Davie
too,” beaming across the table at him.</p>

<p>“Oh, now—give ’em now,” cried Joel,
thrusting out his hand, his black eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>But Mother Pepper said “No,” again; that
they must all wait till after dinner, and the
dishes were washed up and the floor swept.
Then if Phronsie wanted to divide her peppermints,
why, that would be the best time of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>So there was a merry bustle to see who would
get through the part of the work that belonged
to each one. And there was so much fun and
laughter that any one peering in at the little
brown house would really have supposed that
play was going on. At last it was all done,
and Mamsie, over in the corner sewing on one
of the coats that Polly had brought home in
the bundle, declared that everything was very
nice, and that she couldn’t have done it any better
herself.</p>

<p>“Now the peppermints,” cried Joel, running
away from the sink where he had been scrubbing
his hands and polishing them on the big
roller towel. “Now, O goody!” He ran
over to Phronsie, still clinging to her paper
bag.</p>

<p>“Let’s all sit down on the floor,” proposed
Polly. So down the whole four of them got
in a ring, each one drawing a long breath of
anticipation.</p>

<p>“I’m going to give Mamsie one first,” announced
Phronsie, slowly beginning to open
the paper bag.</p>

<p>“Let’s see how many you’ve got, Phronsie,”
said Joel, putting out an impatient hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Don’t, Joey,” said Polly, seizing his hand;
“let Phronsie open her own bag.”</p>

<p>“I’ll open my bag,” hummed Phronsie, suiting
the action to the word. Then she drew out
a peppermint drop, a pink one.</p>

<p>“She’s so slow,” said Joel, impatiently.
“Turn up the bag, do, Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“Let her do it her own way, Joey,” said
Polly; “they are her peppermints and we must
all wait.”</p>

<p>“O dear!” groaned Joel, holding his hands
tightly together, his black eyes on the peppermint
drops.</p>

<p>It took some time in this slow way for
Phronsie to get them all out. She hummed in
a soft little voice as she drew them forth, one
by one, and laid them in Polly’s lap. There
were nine—five white ones, and four pink
ones.</p>

<p>“Aren’t there any more?” cried Joel. “Let
me shake the bag—maybe there’s another
one.”</p>

<p>But all the vigorous shaking that Joel administered
couldn’t produce another peppermint
drop.</p>

<p>“I shall give Mamsie this one,” said Phronsie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
picking up one of the pink drops and running
over to Mrs. Pepper’s chair. “Please
open your mouth, Mamsie.”</p>

<p>And the pink peppermint being dropped into
Mother Pepper’s mouth, Phronsie ran back in
great satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Now me,” cried Joel, sitting back on his
heels, and holding out his hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joey, Ben ought to have one saved for
him,” said Polly reprovingly.</p>

<p>“I shall give Bensie this one,” said Phronsie,
patting another pink drop.</p>

<p>“Ben wouldn’t care,” began Joel. Then he
stopped, seeing Polly’s brown eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said Polly, smiling at Phronsie.
“Now I’m going to put this peppermint
drop up on the table, and you shall give it to
Ben when he comes in.”</p>

<p>“I shall give it to Bensie when he comes in,”
hummed Phronsie. “And this one is for you.”
She held up the third pink peppermint to Polly’s
mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, child,” said Polly, shaking her head.
“You must save those other two for yourself,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Then there won’t be any pink peppermints,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
broke in Joel, awfully disappointed,
“and I wanted one.”</p>

<p>“But Phronsie must save some for herself,”
said Polly; “she just loves pink candy.”</p>

<p>“I will give you a pink one, Joey,” said
Phronsie, beginning to look worried as she saw
his face.</p>

<p>“No, Joel, you oughtn’t to,” said Polly.</p>

<p>“But I don’t want an old white one,”
grumbled Joel; “mean old white one.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better not take any,” said Polly
coolly. “No, Phronsie, you must keep those
two pink ones. Mr. Atkins would want you
to.”</p>

<p>“Would Mr. Atkins want me to?” asked
Phronsie doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” said Polly decidedly.
“Now, Davie, it’s your turn, as Joel doesn’t
want any.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do—I do!” screamed Joel. “I do
want a peppermint, Polly Pepper.”</p>

<p>“All right, then give Joel a white one,
Phronsie, and then one to Davie. There, now
isn’t that too splendid for anything!” as the
two boys began at once to crunch their peppermints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>David suddenly stopped. “You haven’t
any, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Phronsie is going to put a white one in
my mouth,” said Polly gayly, and opening her
mouth very wide.</p>

<p>“I’m going to put one in your mouth,
Polly,” laughed Phronsie. So Polly bent her
head down, and in went a white peppermint
drop.</p>

<p>“Now says I—in goes one in your own
mouth, Phronsie,—a pink one,” and in it went.</p>

<p>There was such a crunching of peppermint
drops going on that no one heard the big green
door open, until Mrs. Pepper said, “Why, how
do you do?” Then they all whirled around.
There was Mr. Tisbett, the stage-driver, whip
in hand.</p>

<p>Immediately he was surrounded by all the
four children, Joel howling, “Oh, I know
you’ve come to take us in the stage-coach,” and
trying to get the whip.</p>

<p>“No, I hain’t, not this time. You let my
whip be, Joel,” and in the midst of the clamor,
he marched over to Mrs. Pepper. “I’ve come
for you, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“For me?” exclaimed Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Yes’m. Ef you don’t stop, Joel Pepper,
scrougin’ for my whip, I’ll—” Mr. Tisbett
didn’t finish, but he looked so very fierce that
they all fell back.</p>

<p>“Hoh!” exclaimed Joel, “I ain’t afraid of
him,” and he swarmed all over the big stage-driver.
“I’m going on the stage. Let me sit
up in front with you, Mr. Tisbett,” he begged.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” Mr. Tisbett tucked the big whip
under his arm, and turned his twinkling eyes
toward Mrs. Pepper. “Old Miss Babbitt has
broke her hip, and—”</p>

<p>“O dear me!” exclaimed Mrs. Pepper, dropping
her work to her lap.</p>

<p>“Fact; fell down th’ cellar stairs; stepped on
th’ cat, an’ away she went.”</p>

<p>“Did she kill the cat?” cried Joel, tearing
off his attention from the whip.</p>

<p>“Land o’ Goshen! You can’t kill a cat,” declared
the stage-driver; “never heard o’ such a
thing in all my born days. Well, she set up a
screechin’ for you, Mis Pepper.” He whirled
around again to Mother Pepper’s chair.</p>

<p>A look of dismay spread over Mother Pepper’s
face.</p>

<p>“She’s in an awful bad fix,” said Mr. Tisbett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
solemnly, “an’ there ain’t a neighbor that’ll go
nigh her. An’ she keeps a-screamin’ for you,”
and Mr. Tisbett leaned against the table.</p>

<p>“Polly, child, come here.” Mrs. Pepper
was already folding up her work.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mamsie?” as the group made
way for her, the stage-driver regarding them
all with a relieved air as if responsibility of the
whole affair was now off his mind.</p>

<p>“Do you think that you could get along without
Mother for a little while?”</p>

<p>“For over night?” asked Polly, in an awe-struck
tone.</p>

<p>“Yes,—can you do it, Polly? Poor old
Miss Babbitt needs me; but I won’t go if you
can’t manage without me.” She rested her
black eyes on Polly’s flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>“You’ve never been away all night,” began
Polly, her cheeks going very white.</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Mrs. Pepper, a little white
line coming around her mouth. “It hasn’t
been necessary before. But now, it seems as if
the poor old woman needs me. And you’re a
big girl, Polly, and then there’s Ben to help you.
Well, what do you say, child?”</p>

<p>“She’s an awful cross old woman,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Polly grudgingly, not being able to look into
her mother’s face.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any difference,” said
Mrs. Pepper. “She needs me.”</p>

<p>Polly drew her shoe back and forth across
the floor, still not looking into her mother’s
face.</p>

<p>“It shall be as you say, Polly,” said Mrs.
Pepper quietly. Meantime the stage-driver
had drawn off into a corner, the three children
surrounding him.</p>

<p>“O dear me!” began Polly, with a long
breath and twisting her hands; then she burst
out, “Mamsie, I’m awfully wicked—but I
don’t want you to go.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mrs. Pepper, “then I will
tell Mr. Tisbett that I cannot go,” and she
began to get out of her chair.</p>

<p>“But supposing,” said Polly, with a little
gasp, seizing her mother’s arm, “nobody had
come to help you when my eyes were bad?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just supposing,” said Mother Pepper,
sitting quite still.</p>

<p>“And now it’s worse, for she’s an old, old
woman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Polly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“Then,” said Polly, feeling sure she was
going to cry, “I think you ought to go, Mamsie.
O dear!”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure, Polly child?”</p>

<p>“Yes-es—yes, Mamsie!” and Polly swallowed
her sob. When she found that she could
do that, she threw her arms around Mrs. Pepper’s
neck. “Oh, Mamsie, I do want you to
go—really and truly, I do, Mamsie—and I’ll
take care of the children.”</p>

<p>“I know you will, Polly. Now that’s my
brave girl,” and Mother Pepper gathered her
up in her arms and held her close.</p>

<p>“And I’ll pack the bag,” said Polly, running
off on happy feet to drag out the old carpet-bag
from the closet in the bedroom.</p>

<p>And pretty soon the kitchen was in a great
bustle, the children getting in each other’s way
to help Mrs. Pepper off. And Mr. Tisbett kept
saying, “Well, I never!” and slapping the big
whip against his knees, making Joel drop whatever
he was doing to run over at the enchanting
sound. And Phronsie had to tie on Mamsie’s
bonnet—and every one hurried to help her
into the stage.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Mother Pepper, as all four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
tried to get on the step for a last kiss. “Be
good, children, and obey Polly!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to be good,” declared Joel
stoutly.</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” said David.</p>

<p>“Let me tie your bonnet again,” said Phronsie,
with pleading hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, Phronsie, you can’t tie it again,” said
Polly. “Mr. Tisbett has got to go,” as the
stage-driver up on the box was cracking his
whip impatiently. “You can kiss Mamsie
once more.”</p>

<p>“I can kiss my Mamsie again,” said Phronsie,
as Polly held her up.</p>

<p>“Good-by, children,” said Mrs. Pepper to
them all, as the big stage lumbered off. But
her last smile was for Polly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>“OLD FATHER DUBBIN”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE four Little Peppers went in and shut
the big green door.</p>

<p>“I want my Mamsie.” Phronsie stood still
in the middle of the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>“So do I,” howled Joel.</p>

<p>Davie began, but stopped at sight of Polly’s
face.</p>

<p>“Now see here,” cried Polly, running over
to throw her arms around Phronsie, “we must
all be good. We promised Mamsie, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I want her back,” cried Joel, in a loud voice,
as Phronsie wailed steadily on.</p>

<p>“How would you like to play ‘Old Father
Dubbin’?” cried Polly, in a shaking voice.
“Wouldn’t that be just too fine for anything!”</p>

<p>“Can we really?” cried Joel, his shouts
breaking off suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Polly. “Now, pet, we are going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
to play ‘Old Father Dubbin.’ Don’t you
want to, Phronsie?”</p>

<p>Phronsie showed her little white teeth in
a merry gurgle. “I do want to play it ever
so much, Polly,” she said, smiling through her
tears.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” screamed Joel, hopping
about. “Come on, Dave, we’re going to
play ‘Old Father Dubbin!’ We haven’t
played it for ever and ever so long,” he added
in an injured tone.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Polly, bustling about.
“Now, boys, come and help me get ready.”</p>

<p>No need to tell them this, as they scampered
after her.</p>

<p>“Old Father Dubbin” was saved, since
Polly made up the game, for very special occasions
like the present when it was absolutely
necessary for the children to be diverted. So
now the kitchen rang with the noise, and they
all spun around till tired out, for of course the
one idea was to keep everybody from a chance
to cry.</p>

<p>At last Polly looked up at the old clock.
“Oh, my goodness!” she exclaimed, brushing
her brown hair out of her eyes. “We’ve got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
to stop. We can’t play all the time. Dear
me! I haven’t got a bit of breath left.”</p>

<p>“I have,” declared Joel, “and we haven’t
played more’n half of all the time. Don’t stop,
Polly—don’t stop!” He came whirling up
to her.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop,” echoed Phronsie, dancing up.
“I want ‘Old Father Dubbin’ some more.”</p>

<p>“I very much wish,” said Davie with red
cheeks, “we could play it again, Polly.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Polly decidedly, “it’s five o’clock,
and we must all set to work now. Besides,
Ben will get home soon.”</p>

<p>“O dear!” grumbled Joel. “What’ll we
work on, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Polly, “you and Davie can go
and chop some kindlings for to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“We’re always chopping kindlings,” said
Joel, peevishly.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Polly, in a cheery voice,
“because we’re always wanting them. Now
go along, boys. I must sweep up, for we’ve
made such a dust playing ‘Old Father Dubbin,’”
and she dashed off after the broom.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to sweep up, too,” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Phronsie, running over to the corner where her
little broom was kept behind the wood-box.</p>

<p>“Come on, Dave, we’ve got to chop those
old kindlings,” said Joel, gloomily, going over
to the door.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bring in a lot,” said Davie,
spreading his arms wide.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bring in enough for two hundred—no,
five hundred mornings,” declared
Joel, as they ran out to the woodshed.</p>

<p>“Now, Phronsie,” said Polly, when the
sweeping up was all done, and the chairs placed
back neatly against the wall, “I think you and
I better set the supper-table. Ben will be here
soon, you know.” She gave a long sigh and
gazed out of the window. Oh, if Ben would
only hurry and come! It was getting dark,
and the hardest hour of all the day to have
Mamsie away was drawing near.</p>

<p>“Bensie will be here soon,” hummed Phronsie,
running over to help Polly lay the table
cloth.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Polly. “Now, that’s a good
girl, Phronsie. You see—”</p>

<p>“I’ve got the most,” cried Joel, staggering
in at the doorway, his arms full of all sorts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
sizes of sticks. “Whickets! See me, Polly!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joey, I don’t want to see you when
you say such words,” said Polly reprovingly.</p>

<p>“I won’t say ’em any more. Now look—<i>look</i>!”
Joel swelled up in front of her, and
brandished his armful.</p>

<p>“O my!” exclaimed Polly, “what a nice
lot! And Davie, too! Dear me, how you two
boys do help!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got so much,” said David, drawing
slowly near with both arms around his kindlings.</p>

<p>“His sticks are better than mine,” said Joel
critically, as the boys stood before Polly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Polly, her head on one side to
view them the better. “I believe they are, Joel.
Well, it’s a nice lot altogether, anyway. Now
put them all in the wood-box.”</p>

<p>“Now what shall we do?” asked Joel, fidgeting
about, the kindlings all dumped in the
wood-box, and going over to Mother Pepper’s
big calico-covered chair, his round face very
sober.</p>

<p>“I believe,” said Polly meditatively, “we’d
better light the candle—it’s growing dark.”</p>

<p>“Why, Polly Pepper! Light the candle!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
exclaimed Joel. “Mamsie wouldn’t light it so
early.”</p>

<p>Phronsie stopped suddenly in putting her
blue and white plate on the table. “I want my
Mamsie,” she said soberly. Then she sat down
in a little bunch on the floor, and put her head
in her lap.</p>

<p>“O dear me!” cried Polly in dismay.
Would Ben <i>ever</i> come! “I wonder if you
don’t all want me to tell you a story.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” screamed Joel and David together,
“we do—we do!” running over to her.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t tell a story ever in all this
world while Phronsie is crying,” said Polly, at
her wits’ end what to do next.</p>

<p>“Phronsie—stop crying!” Joel rushed
over and shook her pink calico sleeve. “Polly
can’t tell a story while you’re crying. She
won’t stop,” he announced wrathfully.</p>

<p>For Phronsie kept on in a smothered little
voice, “I want my Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“Phronsie,” Davie kneeled down on the
kitchen floor beside her. “Please stop. Polly
wants to tell a story. You’ll make Polly sick
if you don’t stop crying.”</p>

<p>Up came Phronsie’s yellow head, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
wiped off the tears with one fat little hand.
“Do I make you sick, Polly?” she asked, in
a tone of deep concern.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I shall be,” said Polly gravely,
“if you don’t stop crying.”</p>

<p>“Then I will stop,” said Phronsie brokenly.
“I don’t want you to be sick, Polly. Please
don’t be.”</p>

<p>“Now if ever there was a good child, it’s
you, Phronsie,” cried Polly, seizing her to
smother the little face with kisses. “Well,
come on, boys, we must sit around the fireplace,
and I’ll tell you a story.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any fireplace,” said Joel, as
Polly led the way over to the stove.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to pretend there is,” said
Polly, getting down on the floor in front of the
stove, “and a splendid fire, too. My! don’t
you hear the logs crackle, and isn’t this blaze
perfectly beautiful!” and she spread out both
hands.</p>

<p>“You’re always pretending there are things
that ain’t there,” grumbled Joel.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Polly gayly, “that’s the
way to have them.”</p>

<p>“I think the blaze is beautiful, too,” declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Davie, throwing himself down by her
side and spreading his hands.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’m going to have some of the
blaze,” said Joel, in an injured tone, and he
crowded in between Polly and David.</p>

<p>“Well now, Phronsie, put your head in my
lap,” said Polly. But she turned a cold
shoulder to Joel.</p>

<p>Joel fidgeted about. “Dave, you can sit
next to Polly,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Polly flashed him a smile
over Phronsie’s yellow head.</p>

<p>“You may have the place,” said Davie, trying
not to want it very much.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” said Polly, “how would
it do for each of you to have the place half of
the time, and I’ll tell you when to change?”</p>

<p>A smile ran over David’s face.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Joel, folding his little
brown hands. “Now begin.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I’m going to tell you about—”
said Polly.</p>

<p>“Oh, the circus story!” shouted Joel wildly.
“Do tell about the circus story, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Do you want the circus story, Davie?”
asked Polly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Say yes, Dave. Do say yes,” said Joel,
nudging him.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said Davie in great satisfaction.</p>

<p>“And you’d like to hear about all the animals,
Phronsie, wouldn’t you?” asked Polly,
bending over the yellow head in her lap.</p>

<p>“Polly,” asked Phronsie, lifting her head in
great excitement, “is that about the dear, sweet
little monkey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pet,” said Polly, “it is.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Phronsie, clapping her hands,
“I should like to hear about it very much indeed.
Please begin right straight off, Polly,”
and she laid her head down in Polly’s lap again.</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” began Polly—would Ben
never come!</p>

<p>“Don’t say, ‘you see,’” interrupted Joel impatiently;
“do tell about the animals, and have
a bear—no, two bears—”</p>

<p>“You’re always having a bear,” said Polly,
with a little laugh. “Well, there were lots of
bears in this circus I am going to tell you of.”</p>

<p>“How many?” demanded Joel.</p>

<p>“Oh, fifty,” said Polly recklessly.</p>

<p>“Whickets!” cried Joel in amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“Now, Joel, I can’t tell any story if you’re
going to say such naughty words.”</p>

<p>“I won’t—I won’t,” cried Joel in alarm at
losing the story. “Were there really fifty
bears, Polly?” He crowded up close to her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Polly, bobbing her brown head.
“And the circus man said he was thinking of
buying two more.”</p>

<p>“O dear me!” cried Joel, quite overcome
and snuggling down against her arm. “Well,
go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, there was a hip-hip-pot-amus,” Polly
finally brought the whole out with great pride.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Joel.</p>

<p>David clasped his hands in silent rapture,
and kept his gaze on the black stove that was
a crackling fire on the hearth.</p>

<p>“And a rho-do-den-dron,” added Polly,
“and—”</p>

<p>“What’s a rho-rho-do—what you said?”
interrupted Joel, his head bobbing up again.</p>

<p>“Oh, a great big creature,” said Polly.</p>

<p>“How big?” demanded Joel.</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness—I can’t ever tell how
big he was,” said Polly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“I want to know how big he was,” grumbled
Joel. “So big?” he spread his arms wide.</p>

<p>“O dear me!” cried Polly, with a little
laugh. “Why, that isn’t anywhere near as
big, Joey Pepper, and he splashed into the
water, and—”</p>

<p>“Where did he splash into the water?” cried
Joel; “say, Polly, where did he?”</p>

<p>“Why, there was a pond next to the circus
tent,” said Polly, going on wildly, her gaze on
the window to see when Ben came around the
corner of the little brown house.</p>

<p>“As big as the pond over at Cherryville?”
demanded Joel.</p>

<p>“Yes, just as big as that,” said Polly, willing
to make it any size.</p>

<p>“Dave,” cried Joel, poking his face over
David’s shoulder, “it was just like that great
big pond over at Cherryville. Only Mr. Tisbett
wouldn’t let us go near it,” he said resentfully;
“he wouldn’t, Polly, when he took us
over on the stage. Well, go on,” and he threw
himself back against Polly once more. “Make
him splash, and splash, that great big thing.
What was his name, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Rho-do-rho-do-den-dron,” said Polly, wishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
she never had seen the picture in the animal
book on Mrs. Blodgett’s center-table.
“Well, now, it’s time for you and Davie to
change places, Joel. Why!”</p>

<p>“Hulloa! So you’ve got a rhododendron,
Polly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ben!” every one of the children
jumped to their feet. Polly got to him first
and threw wild arms around his neck.</p>

<p>“We’ve been playing ‘Old Father Dubbin’,”
announced Davie.</p>

<p>Ben choked off what he was going to ask,
“Where’s Mamsie?” If “Old Father Dubbin”
had been played, something pretty bad
must have happened, for Polly to rescue the
little brown house from gloom with that game.
“Well, now,” he said, “I suppose we’ve got to
have that story finished.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, we have,” howled Joel, dancing
about. “Go on, Polly, do,” and he flopped
down in front of the stove and thrust out his
hands. “There’s a big fire on the hearth,” he
said to Ben.</p>

<p>“And hear the logs crackle,” said Davie, sitting
down by his side and spreading his hands,
too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Oh, I see,” said Ben gravely. “Now come
on, Phronsie, and we’ll hear the rest about that
wonderful rhinoceros,” and he sat down, pulling
her into his lap.</p>

<p>“No, no, that wasn’t his name,” contradicted
Joel; “’twas—oh, what was it, Polly?” and
he wrinkled up his face.</p>

<p>“’Twas what Ben said,” Polly hung her
head.</p>

<p>“Your name is prettier than mine, anyway,
Polly,” said Ben. “Well now let’s hear the
rest of the story.”</p>

<p>So Polly, quite happy now that Ben was
actually there, ran her arm in his, and launched
into such a merry account of what that rhinoceros
was capable of that even Joel was satisfied
and David wasn’t conscious of breathing.</p>

<p>A gentle pull brought Polly to suddenly.
“Tell about my dear, sweet little monkey, do,
Polly,” begged Phronsie.</p>

<p>“To be sure,—how could I forget you?”
cried Polly remorsefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want a monkey,” screamed
Joel; “we can have him any day. Do go on
about that—that—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“See here, Joe,” Ben gave him a small pat
on his back, “it’s time to rest that rhinoceros.
He’s awfully big, and he gets tired easily.”</p>

<p>“Does he?” cried Joel.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, go on about the monkey.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have my dear, sweet monkey
now,” whispered Phronsie in Ben’s ear.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Ben whispered back.
“Well, go on, Polly.”</p>

<p>So the monkey went through all the antics
that belonged to one, and a good many more
that hadn’t anything to do with a monkey at all.</p>

<p>At last Ben looked up at the old clock.
“<i>Whew!</i> Well, Polly Pepper, I should say it
was time for supper!”</p>

<p>At that they all jumped up, and in the scuffle
to get to the table first, Polly drew Ben aside.
“Mamsie’s gone to old Miss Babbitt’s,” she
whispered. “Mr. Tisbett came for her. Miss
Babbitt has broken her hip.”</p>

<p>“<i>Whew!</i>” said Ben again.</p>

<p>“And how shall ever we get the children to
bed,” said Polly, in a distressed little voice,
“without Mamsie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>Ben looked all around the old kitchen with a
sober face. “Same’s you’ve done all the afternoon—keep
’em busy.”</p>

<p>“We can’t play ‘Old Father Dubbin’
again,” said Polly. “We must save that for
next times when things are bad.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Ben; “then it must be
blind man’s buff, or puss-in-the-corner, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“What are you whispering about?” cried
Joel, coming up curiously. “You’re always
getting off into a corner and whispering
things.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s because we can’t talk unless
we do get into a corner. You’re always poking
around so, Joe,” said Ben. “Come on now,
all hands to supper!”</p>

<p>He swung Phronsie up to his shoulder and
then into the chair that he had made high
enough for her by nailing a board across two
strips of wood. “Now says I, here you go,
Puss!”</p>

<p>They were all so tired when they got through
with blind man’s buff, the supper dishes first
being well out of the way, that Phronsie, who
wanted to be “Puss,” fell asleep on the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
cricket before they could get her into the corner.
So Polly bundled her off to the trundle-bed and
tucked her up with a kiss.</p>

<p>“Now the worst is over,” she said, coming
out of the bedroom, to Ben.</p>

<p>“And you two boys—it’s time you were
off,” said Ben, pointing to the loft, “or you’ll
tumble asleep like Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sleepy,” said Joel, digging his
knuckles into his black eyes and trying to keep
awake.</p>

<p>“I am,” said Davie, “and my legs are tired.”
And he stumbled off to the loft stairs.</p>

<p>“Hoh!” exclaimed Joel, following slowly,
“I ain’t sleepy a single bit. And Polly and
you are going to talk over secrets after we’re
gone,” and he turned half-way up the loft stairs
to show an injured face.</p>

<p>“Well, you wouldn’t hear any secrets if you
stayed,” declared Ben coolly, “so you might as
well take yourself off, Joe.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE OLD BOOK BOX</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. PARSON HENDERSON for once
left her breakfast dishes unwashed.</p>

<p>“It’s no use—I must get over to the little
brown house at once.” She took down her
sunbonnet from its nail in the entry and stopped
to put her head in the study doorway.</p>

<p>“You’ll be surprised to see the kitchen if you
go out there,” she said, “and the morning work
not done.”</p>

<p>“Jerusha isn’t here, so no matter,” said the
parson, looking up from next Sunday’s sermon
with a smile.</p>

<p>“I can’t keep away from those poor Pepper
children, since you heard down at the store
that their mother was away last night at Miss
Babbitt’s.”</p>

<p>“Almira, I’m glad enough that you’re going
over to see Polly. I thought it would be as
much as my life was worth to suggest it till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
those breakfast dishes were washed.” He
laughed now like a boy.</p>

<p>“There are some things more important than
breakfast dishes,” observed his wife grimly.
Then she hurried off, cross-lots, to the little
brown house.</p>

<p>Nobody was in the old kitchen; that she saw
through the window. So she hurried around
the house and there under the scraggy apple-tree
was Polly before the big tub on its bench,
scrubbing away on a pile of clothes and trying
to sing, but it was a quavering little voice that
the parson’s wife heard.</p>

<p>“Go and get your little tub, Phronsie,” said
Polly, breaking off from the poor little song,
“and wash Seraphina’s clothes.”</p>

<p>“I want my Mamsie.” Phronsie, a picture
of woe, stood quite still under a sheltering
branch of the old apple-tree.</p>

<p>“Oh, Phronsie,” said Polly, trying to speak
gayly, “just think of Seraphina, poor dear,
wanting her clothes washed. Only think,
Phronsie!”</p>

<p>“I want my Mamsie,” said Phronsie, not
offering to stir. Her lips trembled and Polly
knew in another moment that the tears would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
come in a torrent; so she flung her hands clear
of the soap suds and started to run over to her.
Instead she plunged into the parson’s wife just
making up her mind to come around the corner
into full view.</p>

<p>“O dear!” gasped Polly in dismay, her
soapy hands flying up against the clean blue
print dress.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Mrs. Henderson, “soap
never hurt any calico dress,” seizing the wet
hands. “O my!” and she hurried over to
Phronsie, too scared at Polly’s plunge to cry.</p>

<p>“Well—well.” Then as Polly ran to get
a dry cloth to wipe off the front of the clean
print dress, the parson’s wife sat down on one
of the big stones that Ben and the other boys
had brought into “the orchard” to play tea-party
with whenever the much-prized hours
from work would allow.</p>

<p>Phronsie came slowly to her. “I want my
Mamsie,” she said, patting Mrs. Henderson’s
gown to attract attention. “I want her very
much indeed, I do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know.” Then the parson’s wife
lifted her on her lap. “So does Polly want
Mamsie—and Davie. Where is Davie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>Phronsie pointed a small finger up to the
branches of the apple-tree.</p>

<p>“Oh, Davie, are you there?” Mrs. Henderson
cocked up one eye. There sat Davie
huddled up in a crotch of the tree, his head in
his hands. “Dear me. I thought it was a
big bird!”</p>

<p>“Davie is a big bird,” echoed Phronsie,
smiling through the tears that were just ready
to roll down.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he,” said the parson’s wife with a
little laugh. “Well, now, come down, big
bird.”</p>

<p>“Come down, big bird,” cried Phronsie,
clapping her hands and hopping up and down,
as Polly ran out with the clean cloth.</p>

<p>“Now that is as good as ever,” declared
Mrs. Henderson, as Polly wiped off all trace
of the soap suds. “Well, here comes Davie,”
as he slid slowly down from branch to branch.</p>

<p>“That’s a good boy, Davie,” said Polly approvingly,
the sparkle coming back to the
brown eyes.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he?” said Mrs. Henderson. “Well,
now, Davie, I wonder if you won’t come over
to the parsonage and help me this morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Can I help you?” asked Davie, raising his
swollen eyes to her.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; ever so much,” declared Mrs.
Henderson quickly. “I’ve some work to have
done in setting up my attic, and you can help
me.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll come,” said Davie, with a long
breath of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Now that’s good,” said the parson’s wife.</p>

<p>“I want to go, too,” said Phronsie, laying
hold of Mrs. Henderson’s gown.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the parson’s wife, “you
must stay and help Polly. Poor Polly—see
how busy she is!” pointing over to the wash-tub
where Polly was splashing away for dear
life.</p>

<p>Phronsie’s hand dropped from Mrs. Henderson’s
gown. She ran over unsteadily to
the big tub on its bench. “I’m going to help
you, Polly,” she said, standing on her tiptoes.</p>

<p>“So you shall,” said Polly, flashing over a
bright smile to the parson’s wife. “Run and
get your little tub, and see if you can get Seraphina’s
clothes washed as quickly as these,” she
doused one of the boy’s little calico jackets up
and down in the suds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“But I want to help on these things,” said
Phronsie, patting the big tub with a disappointed
little hand. “Please, Polly, let me.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Polly decidedly, “there isn’t
room for more than one here. Besides Mamsie
wouldn’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t Mamsie like it for me to help in
the big tub?” asked Phronsie.</p>

<p>“No, she wouldn’t,” said Polly decidedly.</p>

<p>Phronsie slowly let her hand drop to her
side. “Would Mamsie want me to wash
dolly’s clothes?” she asked, her blue eyes fastened
on Polly’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, she certainly would,” declared
Polly decidedly. “There now, that’s clean,
until Joey gets it dirty again,” and she wrung
out the little calico blouse.</p>

<p>“Then I shall wash my dolly’s clothes,” declared
Phronsie, marching off to the woodshed
where her little tub was kept.</p>

<p>“And you come with me, David,” said Mrs.
Henderson, “for I must get to work in my
attic. Polly, don’t worry, child—we’ll find
some way to get your mother back here,” she
whispered on the way out of the yard. And
taking David’s hand, the parson’s wife went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
swiftly home, hoping at every step that no
parishioner had caught sight of those unwashed
breakfast dishes.</p>

<p>“I’m going to wipe them dry,” said David,
as she poured the boiling water into the dish-pan.
“May I, Mrs. Henderson?”</p>

<p>“You certainly may,” said the parson’s wife,
setting the big iron tea-kettle back on the stove.
“Now that’s a good boy, Davie Pepper. Get
a clean towel in the table-drawer.”</p>

<p>So Davie ran over and fished out a clean
towel, and the dishes were soon done and piled
on the dresser. And none too soon! Here
came around the corner of the parsonage, Miss
Keturah Sims to borrow a colander to strain
blackberries in.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to make jell this mornin’,” she announced,
coming in without the formality of
knocking, “an’ my colander’s bust.” Her
sharp black eyes, the sharpest pair in all
Badgertown for finding out things, as the parson’s
wife knew quite well, roved all over the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“You shall have it,” cried Mrs. Henderson,
running into the pantry on happy feet. “Oh,
Davie Pepper,” she cried, as the door closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
on Miss Sims, “you don’t know how you’ve
helped me!” She stopped to drop a kiss on
the soft light hair.</p>

<p>“Have I?” cried David, very much pleased.
“Have I helped you, Mrs. Henderson?”</p>

<p>“Indeed you have!” she declared. Then
she stopped in the middle of the kitchen. “I
remember what your mother once said.”</p>

<p>David drew near, holding his breath. To
hear what Mamsie said was always a treat not
to be lightly put one side.</p>

<p>“She said,” repeated Mrs. Henderson, “that
if any one felt bad about anything, the best
way was to get up and do something for somebody.
And so you stopped crying and worrying
Polly and came over here. And you don’t
know, David Pepper, how you’ve helped me!
Well, we must get up into the attic.” She hurried
over to the broom closet. “Get the dust-pan,
David, behind the stove.”</p>

<p>“I will,” cried David, clattering after it.</p>

<p>“And the little brush.”</p>

<p>“Yes—I will.”</p>

<p>“And the dust-cloth, hanging on the back
entry nail,” Mrs. Henderson’s voice trailed
down the attic stairs. And Davie, gathering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
up the various things, hurried up after her.</p>

<p>“Dear me, how hot it is!” exclaimed the
parson’s wife, hurrying over to open the window
at the end.</p>

<p>“I’ll open it,” cried David, depositing his
armful so hastily that down the stairs rattled
the little brush and the dust-pan, and only the
dust-cloth remained.</p>

<p>“No, no, Davie, I must open it,” said Mrs.
Henderson, suiting the action to the word.
“And remember, dear,” as he brought back
the truant articles, “you must wait patiently
till I tell you what to do.”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry,” said David penitently, still
holding the runaway broom and dust-pan.</p>

<p>“I know, dear—and next time, remember
to wait until I tell you what I want you to do.
Well, the first thing, now that the window is
open, and we have some fresh air to work by,
is to get these trunks and boxes out from this
corner.” She was over there by this time and
down on her knees under the eaves.</p>

<p>“I’ll pull ’em out,” began Davie; then he
stopped and looked at her, “if you want me
to.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good boy,” Mrs. Henderson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
turned and looked at him. “You’ve no idea
what a comfort it is, David Pepper, to have
any one who wants to help, wait till he’s told
what to do! Well, you mustn’t even attempt
to pull these trunks and boxes about. We will
each take hold of a handle, then it will be easy
to shove them out.” She got up suddenly.
<i>Rap!</i> went her head against a low-lying beam.</p>

<p>David stared at her in dismay. “O dear!”
he exclaimed, quite aghast.</p>

<p>“Yes, that did hurt,” said the parson’s wife,
feeling of her head, “and it was all because I
was in too big a hurry. Now I’m going down
stairs to bathe it, and you may—” She hesitated
and looked about. “Why there is that
little box of books, David. You may take
them out and dust them, for somebody has left
the cover off. There it is now, behind that
table.” She pointed to an ancestral piece of
furniture with one leg missing. “Take your
dust-cloth, child, and begin, then pile the books
neatly in the box, and set the cover on,” and
she went swiftly down the stairs.</p>

<p>David ran over and picked up the dust-cloth
where he had thrown it on the floor. <i>Books!</i>—to
think there were books in that box! His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
small fingers tingled to begin, and he threw
himself down on the floor beside the box, and
peered in. There were green books, and red
ones, and very dull gray and black ones, all
more or less dilapidated.</p>

<p>He drew a long breath, his blue eyes widening
as his hands clutched the sides of the box.
“I better take ’em all out first,” he said to himself,
and lifting the upper layer very carefully,
he laid them down, one by one, on the floor beside
him. A red-covered book, the back of the
binding almost in tatters, slipped from his fingers
and fell to the attic floor.</p>

<p>“O dear me!” he was going to exclaim,
when his gaze fell upon the pages before him.
There was a big picture on one side and a whole
lot of reading on the other page.</p>

<p>David leaned over to stare at the picture.
Then he rested his elbows on the attic floor and
stared harder than ever. The picture showed
a boy seated before a desk, bent over a slate,
on which he was writing, and opposite to him
the book said, “I must get my lesson for to-morrow,”
in great big letters.</p>

<p>David knew very well what these big letters
said, for Mother Pepper had often told Polly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
to lay down her work when she was trying to
help Mamsie on the coats for Mr. Atkins, telling
her, “You have sewed enough, Polly child.
Now get the big Bible from the bedroom, and
read aloud. And then you can teach the children,
Polly,” she would always add.</p>

<p>So Davie had picked up everything he possibly
could about any big letters that were
likely to come his way.</p>

<p>“The boy is going to school,” said David,
unable to tear his eyes from the picture, “and
he’s going to learn a lesson. O dear, I wonder
when I shall ever go to school! And he’s
got a slate and pencil.”</p>

<p>At that David was so lost at the idea of any
boy being rich enough to own a slate and pencil,
that he sat perfectly still, and a big spider
hurried out of her web and ran along the
eaves, to stare down at him. Finally seeing
that he didn’t stir, she slipped down swiftly on
her gossamer thread, and landed right in the
middle of the book with the dilapidated red
binding. This woke David up. And of
course Mrs. Spider then ran for her life.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see if there are other boys
with slates and pencils,” said David, turning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
leaves. There lay the dust-cloth beside him,
but he never thought of that. And as he
couldn’t read very much, but had to study each
letter carefully, he didn’t get on very fast, especially
as there was a picture on every other
page. And of course he must see what the big
letters opposite said it was all about.</p>

<p>The first thing he knew there were some
steps coming up the attic stairs.</p>

<p>David’s head came up suddenly, and the old
book slipped away from his grasp.</p>

<p>“My mother says you are to come down to
dinner,” said Peletiah, coming slowly up.</p>

<p>David stared at him. Then his little face
got hot all over.</p>

<p>“My mother says you are to come down to
dinner,” said the parson’s son.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t,” said David miserably, and
his head hung down.</p>

<p>“My mother says you are to come down to
dinner,” Peletiah said, exactly as if giving the
message for the first time.</p>

<p>“No, no,” said David, unable to see anything
but the idle dust-cloth lying on the floor.</p>

<p>“My mother says—” began the parson’s
son, not moving from his tracks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“Da—<i>vid</i>!” called a voice over the attic
stairs, “come, child, to dinner. You must be
hungry, working so hard.”</p>

<p>David crouched down by the side of the box.
“I haven’t worked,” he said, “and I can’t have
any dinner.”</p>

<p>“My mother says—”</p>

<p>“Yes, come, child,” called the voice over the
attic stairs, “and, Peletiah, you must come
down, too.” Peletiah, considering the last
command to come to dinner much more to
his taste and more binding than the message he
was sent up to the attic to deliver, shut his
mouth as he was just going to begin on his
message once more, and went down the stairs.</p>

<p>David looked wildly around as he was left
alone, with no one but the big spider now in
her home web once more. To get to the little
brown house and to Polly was now his only
thought! He would be carrying disgrace there—but
he must go. Then jumping to his feet,
he ran as fast as he could down the attic stairs
to the back entry. The knives and forks were
going pretty fast as he dashed past the dining-room.
Oh, how jolly it all sounded, and a
most enticing smell of all things good was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
the air, as he dashed past and out into the parsonage
yard.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Parson Henderson,
and he laid down the big carving knife and
fork just as Mrs. Henderson was saying, “I
wonder why Davie Pepper doesn’t come down
to dinner. I’ve neglected the poor child, for
when Mrs. Jones came to see me about the
Sewing Society, I couldn’t get back to the
attic.”</p>

<p>Peletiah got out of his chair and went to
the window, followed by Ezekiel. “There’s
David Pepper,” he said, pointing with a slow
finger to a small boy running blindly on across
the parsonage yard.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DAVID rushed into the old kitchen in a
whirlwind of distress. There was no
one there, and stumbling over to Mamsie’s big
calico-covered chair, he flung himself down and
buried his head on the cushion.</p>

<p>“Now, Phronsie,” said Polly, running in,
“you’ve been such a good girl, I’m going to
give you a piece of that gingerbread dear Mrs.
Beebe gave us the other day. Shut the door,
child.”</p>

<p>Phronsie obediently pushed the big green
door to, and pattered after Polly.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Polly, running her head into
the old corner cupboard, “Ben and Joel will
have a good dinner at Deacon Blodgett’s, and
Davie is at the parsonage—I’m so glad he was
such a good boy to help Mrs. Henderson.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ugh!</i>” came a noise from the corner over
by Mrs. Pepper’s big chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“What was that?” cried Polly, pulling her
head out of the cupboard. “Don’t be afraid,
child,” as Phronsie huddled up to her.</p>

<p>“But I am, Polly,” said Phronsie, snuggling
up closer than ever, “very much afraid.”</p>

<p>“Mamsie said we weren’t to be afraid at
things, but to see what they were, so I’m going
to.” Polly ran across the old kitchen, Phronsie
hanging to her.</p>

<p>“<i>Why, David Pepper!</i>” cried Polly, nearly
tumbling over him as she ran around Mother
Pepper’s big chair. Then she turned very
white.</p>

<p>“What is it, Davie? Oh, where are you
hurt?” she asked, while Phronsie with a little
wail, threw her arms around him, too.</p>

<p>“I’m not hurt,” sobbed David. “O dear,
dear!”</p>

<p>“<i>Not hurt!</i>” gasped Polly, hanging to the
chair.</p>

<p>“I’ve been a bad boy,” cried David in a
spasm of grief, and holding to the old cushion
with desperate little hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, never, Davie,” exclaimed Polly, “you
couldn’t be ever in all this world. Why, you
are our Davie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>At this Davie’s despair was greater than
ever, and he burrowed his face deeper in the
old chair.</p>

<p>“You see, Davie,” Polly ran on, “Mamsie
trusts you, so you couldn’t be bad.” Phronsie
meanwhile had sunk to the floor, and was
silently gazing at the misery, lost to everything
else. “No, you couldn’t be bad, because Mamsie
trusts you so,” she repeated.</p>

<p>This was so much worse that David began
to scream, and without any more words, Polly
lifted him up and sitting down in Mamsie’s
chair, she held him tightly in her lap.</p>

<p>“Now, David Pepper,” she said sternly,
“you’ve just got to tell me what you’ve done.”</p>

<p>“I—I—can’t,” David hid his wet little
face on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Mamsie tells us not to say ‘can’t,’” said
Polly decidedly. “Begin and tell me.”</p>

<p>“She—told—me—” began David in a
shaking voice.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Henderson?”</p>

<p>David bobbed his head.</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“She—told—me—to—”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“To dust—the—books—and—”</p>

<p>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“And I didn’t—O dear!”</p>

<p>“And you disobeyed dear Mrs. Henderson!
Oh, David Pepper, how could you!” Polly
turned very white again, and cold little shivers
ran up and down her back. To think that the
parsonage people should ever have one of the
Pepper children disobey them!</p>

<p>When Polly said, “David Pepper, how could
you!” it wasn’t to be lightly borne. So now
Davie raised such a despairing little face that
Polly hastened to say, “Well, you must tell me
all about it.”</p>

<p>“There was a boy in the book—”</p>

<p>“What boy?” said Polly, very much
puzzled.</p>

<p>“I was going to dust him, and the other
books.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean you were going to dust the
books,” said Polly, beginning to see a little
light.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said David, trying to keep back the
sobs.</p>

<p>“Well, stop crying and tell me all about it—every
single thing.” Polly gathered him up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
more closely. “Now then, Davie, you began
to dust the boy.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” said Davie in a fresh
anguish; “I didn’t dust him a bit; not once,
Polly—O dear!”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Polly.</p>

<p>“He had a slate and pencil, and—and—he
was going to school,” said Davie in another
outburst of grief.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said Polly with more light,
“and you wanted to read about him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” said Davie; “it told all about
him.”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you dust the books just
as Mrs. Henderson told you? It didn’t take
long, I’m sure, to find out about that boy.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to see if other boys were going to
school, and had slates and pencils—O dear!”
he sobbed.</p>

<p>“Well, now I guess I know all about it,”
said Polly. “Phronsie, you must stop crying,”
for Phronsie was softly wailing on the
floor in front of Mamsie’s old chair. “You
forgot about dusting the books, Davie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” said Davie. “O dear!” and
he burrowed further than ever in her arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Well, that <i>was</i> bad,” said Polly, “when
she told you to do it. But it’s worse to cry
about it now—because crying doesn’t help it
any. Well, now, is there anything else to tell
me?”</p>

<p>“Peletiah came up in the attic, and told me
to come down to dinner. And Mrs. Henderson
called me and—”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t go?” cried Polly in astonishment.</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t have any dinner, I’d been
bad—and I ran home.”</p>

<p>“O dear—dear!” exclaimed Polly in great
distress. To have one of the children lacking
in politeness was a terrible thing, and here was
a blow that quite unnerved her. When David
saw that, he was quite overcome, and he cried
on steadily.</p>

<p>“Something must be done,” thought Polly.
“O dear, if Mamsie were only here.”</p>

<p>“David,” she said, “you must go straight
back to the parsonage, and beg Mrs. Henderson
to forgive you.”</p>

<p>David shrank into a little heap. “Oh, I
can’t do that, Polly; she’ll make me stay to
dinner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“That would never do,” said Polly.</p>

<p>So she hopped out of the big chair and set
him on his feet. “I’ll get you something to
eat, and then you can tell her you have been to
dinner if she asks you.” And presently David
was seated before the old table, and eating, as
well as he could for his tears, a cold potato well
sprinkled with salt and a generous slice of
brown bread.</p>

<p>But he didn’t get to the parsonage after all,
for just as he was swallowing the last mouthful,
in walked the parson’s wife.</p>

<p>“I want you to come over to-morrow,
Davie,” she said, just as if nothing in the world
a bit unpleasant had happened, “and you and I
will work in the attic.”</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Henderson, Davie has something
he wants to say to you,” Polly began in
a trembling voice.</p>

<p>David got out of his chair and went over on
unsteady feet to her.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to be bad,” he said, his poor
swollen little face working dreadfully.</p>

<p>“I know, dear,” said the parson’s wife,
bending over him sympathetically, and stroking
the soft, wavy hair with a kind hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“But it was bad,” said Polly, “for him to
forget, and not obey you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Henderson.</p>

<p>“And I’m sorry,” said Davie, his hands
twisting together.</p>

<p>“And you’ll come to-morrow, and help me,
and that will show that you are sorry,” said the
parson’s wife.</p>

<p>“I’ll go to-morrow,” said David, with a
crooked little smile.</p>

<p>“And Peletiah and Ezekiel are going away
to their grandmother’s again to-morrow,” said
Mrs. Henderson, “just as they did to-day.
So, you see, I shall need you very much, Davie.”</p>

<p>“Now, how in the world can I find any one
to take Mrs. Pepper’s place nursing Miss Babbitt?”
The parson’s wife puckered up her
forehead all the way down the road with anxious
thought. “If here doesn’t come Dr.
Fisher!” as the old gig swung into view at the
turn of the road.</p>

<p>Dr. Fisher pulled up suddenly. But she
didn’t wait for the old horse to stop. “Dr.
Fisher,” she began, hurrying up to the side of
the gig, “can’t we find some one to take Mrs.
Pepper’s place over at Miss Babbitt’s?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Dr. Fisher looked out at her gloomily. “I’d
give a good deal if we could,” he said. “That
idiot of a Bunce woman—she was there when
Miss Babbitt fell down the cellar stairs, and
she began to scream for Mrs. Pepper. And
she rushed out—the Bunce woman—and
caught Mr. Tisbett going by on the stage, and
sent him for Mrs. Pepper. And now Mrs.
Pepper won’t desert Miss Babbitt.” He
switched the whip gloomily from side to side,
his face getting more and more sober every
moment.</p>

<p>“But she must desert Miss Babbitt,” declared
the parson’s wife frantically.</p>

<p>“You know Mrs. Pepper will never desert
any one in trouble.” The little doctor slapped
the whip into its socket and glared at her
through his big horn spectacles.</p>

<p>“There’s Polly doing her best to keep things
together,” cried Mrs. Henderson; “’twould go
to your heart, Dr. Fisher, to see her!”</p>

<p>“It’s gone to my heart a good many times,”
said the little doctor, relapsing into gloom
again, “to see her. But what can we do?
There isn’t a woman fit to take care of Miss
Babbitt, who’d be willing to go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“There’s Mary Pote,” said the parson’s wife
suddenly with a brightening face.</p>

<p>“Mary Pote?—well, Miss Parrott owns
her, soul and body.” Dr. Fisher set his big
spectacles straighter on his nose and glared at
the parson’s wife worse than ever.</p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t do any harm to try,” said Mrs.
Henderson. “Maybe Miss Parrott would let
her go.”</p>

<p>The little doctor sniffed scornfully. “Well,
will you try?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson looked off to the distant
fields, an awful feeling at her heart. Then she
swallowed hard. “Yes, I will,” she said, “if
I can get over to Miss Parrott’s.”</p>

<p>“No trouble about <i>that</i>,” cried little Dr.
Fisher joyfully. “Hop right in, Mrs. Henderson,”
and before her resolution had time to
cool, there she was in the doctor’s gig and well
along on the way to the estate of the aristocratic
Miss Parrott.</p>

<p>When the gig turned into the handsome
stone gateway, the parson’s wife had all she
could do to keep from jumping out over the
wheel. Suppose she should anger the only rich
parishioner of her husband’s! But she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
there on the big stone steps, and the butler was
opening the heavy oaken door. There was
nothing to do but to go in, Dr. Fisher driving
off to call for her later. And presently she was
ushered into the long drawing-room, with its
rich carpeting, its ancestral furniture and portraits,
all shrouded in the gloom of an apartment
little used, and left to her wildly beating
heart for the only sound to entertain her.</p>

<p>And there presently broke in the rustle of a
stiff black silk gown advancing toward her,
and in the gloom she saw the tall and haughty
figure of the rich Miss Parrott.</p>

<p>How she told her story, she never could remember,
but it was all out at last. And Miss
Parrott sat erect, without uttering a word until
the parson’s wife thought as she told her husband
that night, “I should go through the
floor.”</p>

<p>At last Miss Parrott broke the silence.
“It’s those little brown house people you want
to help?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Henderson, unable to get
out another word.</p>

<p>“And you want me to let Mary Pote go to
take care of Miss Babbitt?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Yes,” said the parson’s wife faintly, “at
least till they can get Miss Babbitt’s niece to
come.”</p>

<p>“<i>Um</i>—” There wasn’t another sound in
the room except the wild beating of Mrs. Henderson’s
heart, until Miss Parrott got her long
figure out of the high-backed chair, and the
stiff black silk gown rustled over to the bell-cord.</p>

<p>“Send Mary Pote to me,” said Miss Parrott
to the stiff old butler who appeared.</p>

<p>And again there was silence in the long
gloomy drawing-room. Mrs. Henderson
couldn’t tell, for the life of her, whether or no
she had harmed her husband’s interests, perhaps
driven him from Badgertown parish. At
last in came Mary Pote, a round, roly-poly person,
half seamstress—half dressmaker, solely
devoted to the spinster’s interests, who lived in
a small cottage on the Parrott estate. Who ever
thought of asking for Mary Pote’s services!</p>

<p>“Mary Pote,” said Miss Parrott, “you may
get your bonnet, and pack your bag. You are
to go to take care of some tiresome old person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
who had nothing better to do than to fall down
the cellar stairs and break her hip.”</p>

<p>“But I was making over your black batiste,
Miss Parrott,” began Mary Pote with the
privilege of an old servant.</p>

<p>“When I want my black batiste finished, I
will tell you so, Mary Pote. Do as I bid you.
Oh, one thing more. You are going so that a
Mrs. Pepper—she’s the mother of some children
living in a poor old brown house in
Badgertown—”</p>

<p>“I know them,” said Mary Pote, turning
back.</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt me—well, their mother
has gone to take care of that odious old Miss
Babbitt, and you are to take her place.”</p>

<p>“Now I’m glad enough to go,” cried Mary
Pote joyfully, “for that Mrs. Pepper of all
folks is the best woman, and—”</p>

<p>“There, there,” said Miss Parrott, waving
her off with long fingers on which ancestral
rings shone. “Get along, Mary Pote, and do
as I say. One thing more—tell Simmons to
get the brougham ready and drive Mrs. Henderson
and you down there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>The parson’s wife got out of her chair.
“Dr. Fisher brought me, and he will take me
back,” she said.</p>

<p>Miss Parrott waved her back with the long
fingers.</p>

<p>“I know nothing about how you got here,”
she said; “it doesn’t interest me in the least.
I am taking charge of the case now, and not
Dr. Fisher, nor anybody else.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>“I’D TRY TO LEARN”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“NOW, David, it’s your turn.” Mr. Atkins
leaned both hands on the counter.
“What did you want?”</p>

<p>“Three pounds of Indian meal, if you
please.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy got, an’ it’s fresh an’ sweet.”
The storekeeper went over to the big box in the
corner. “Thought I never should get round
to wait on you. Beats all how some women
trade. That Miss Pride ’ud finger everything
in the place, an’ finally buy a lemon. Well,
here you be!” He twisted up the paper bag
with an extra twirl and handed it over the
counter. “Well now, how’s things over to the
little brown house?”</p>

<p>David reached up with a shaking hand for
the paper bag.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins picked up the knife and cut off a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
snip from the big yellow cheese, and began to
chew it. “He’s too little,” he said to himself;
“no, I’ve got to find some other way to help
’em. <i>Hem!</i> well—” and he cut off another
snip, “I s’pose Polly finds it pretty easy to keep
the little brown house goin’ these days, don’t
she?”</p>

<p>David’s face turned quite white. If he could
only forget how he had run out that very
morning to get the kindlings behind the wood-pile,
and Ben and Polly were talking!</p>

<p>“It’s every bit,” said Ben, turning his old
leather purse upside down, “ten cents, Polly.”</p>

<p>“O dear—dear! What shall we do, Ben?
The potatoes are ’most gone and everything is
so much worse!”</p>

<p>“Don’t feel so bad, Polly. Things will get
better, I guess,” said Ben.</p>

<p>And then Davie, peering around the wood-pile,
saw him pat Polly’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ben,” said Polly, and she threw her arms
around his neck, “we must think up some more
ways to help Mamsie. We <i>must</i>, Ben.”</p>

<p>Ben held Polly closely, but he said nothing,
for he couldn’t for his life think of a word of
comfort, and his face worked dreadfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“O dear me!” cried Polly in dismay when
she saw that; “don’t look so, Ben. And <i>you</i>
mustn’t feel bad.”</p>

<p>“Polly,” said Ben, drawing a long breath,
“we’ll both think hard, and meantime, you and
I mustn’t stop our work. We ought to be at it
this very minute.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Polly, breaking away from
him, “and Mamsie told me to send Davie down
to the store for some Indian meal.”</p>

<p>At that Davie ducked behind the wood-pile,
and then ran after Polly into the little brown
house. And now here he was in all his misery,
standing before the counter, with Mr. Atkins
asking this dreadful question!</p>

<p>“Hem!” said the storekeeper again. Seeing
Davie’s face, he couldn’t keep eating cheese
all day, so he threw down the knife, and before
he knew it, he was saying, “How would you
like to come here an’ help me keep store a little
while every now and then?”</p>

<p>Davie’s blue eyes flew open at their widest,
and he had all he could do to hang to the paper
bag of Indian meal.</p>

<p>“You could set here an’ watch things,” Mr.
Atkins ran on, surprised to find how very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
he needed a small boy for that very thing, that
hadn’t occurred to him before. “An’ then
when I want to go to dinner, I’d admire to have
th’ store kep’ open.” At last he stopped suddenly.
“What d’ye say, Davie?”</p>

<p>Davie found his voice after swallowing very
hard.</p>

<p>“Could I really help you, Mr. Atkins?” he
burst out, standing on his tiptoes, the very idea
making him quite tall.</p>

<p>“<i>Sure!</i>” declared the storekeeper, slapping
his thigh. “Beats all why I didn’t think of it
before. Well, what d’ye say, David?”</p>

<p>The color rushed all over David’s face till it
became rosy red. “Oh, Mr. Atkins,” and he
dropped the bag, “can I come here and help
keep the store?” and he clasped his hands.</p>

<p>“That’s what I been a-sayin’ to you,” cried
the storekeeper, his pale green eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“Can I really?”</p>

<p>“Sure as shootin’—I’d like it first rate.
You’d be an awful help. You see, you could
find out what folks wanted, an’ come an’ call
me when I’m in th’ house.” Mr. Atkins
pointed his big thumb over to the door that shut
off the place where he ate and slept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Yes,” cried Davie, eagerly, “I could, Mr.
Atkins.”</p>

<p>“An’ then you—you could hand me th’
string when I wanted to tie up th’ bundles.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could.”</p>

<p>“An’ then,” said Mr. Atkins, casting about
in his mind for the other things that now
loomed up as most important in which he was
to be helped, “why then, you could hand me th’
paper.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Davie, “an’ couldn’t I sometimes
tie up bundles, Mr. Atkins?” he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if you could,” cried
Mr. Atkins; “you’re so smart, Davie Pepper,
you’d learn real easy,” and he slapped his thigh
again.</p>

<p>“I’d try to learn,” cried David in a glow,
“and then I could help you, couldn’t I, Mr.
Atkins, keep store when I could tie up
bundles?”</p>

<p>“You’d help me splendid before you learn
to tie up bundles,” declared Mr. Atkins just as
excited, “just bein’ here an’ waitin’ on me.”</p>

<p>“And I’m going to learn to tie up bundles,”
cried David in a transport. Then he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
down at the paper bag of Indian meal at his
feet, and he hung his head. “I’m so sorry,”
he faltered. Oh, now Mr. Atkins wouldn’t
want him, of course. A boy who dropped
bundles all over the place wasn’t to be trusted;
and this splendid chance to help Mamsie was
gone.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t such a dreadful thing to do,” observed
the storekeeper, leaning his long figure
over the counter to take note of the trouble.
“I dropped bundles when I was a boy, Davie.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” said David, greatly relieved
that a boy who grew up to be such a smart man
as the village storekeeper did such a thing;
and he picked up the paper bag with hope once
more springing in his heart.</p>

<p>“<i>Sure!</i>” declared Mr. Atkins, “I was a
great deal bigger than you be.”</p>

<p>“How much bigger, Mr. Atkins?” asked
David, clutching his bag.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess ’most a foot taller,” said Mr.
Atkins, scratching his head, “an’ once I
dropped a ’lasses jug.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Atkins!” exclaimed David, quite
overwhelmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Yes, I did,” said the storekeeper, delighted
to see the comfort this revelation gave. “An’
’twas in th’ dusty road. Just think of that,
David Pepper!”</p>

<p>“Can I help fill molasses jugs when people
want them?” asked Davie suddenly. If that
could ever be allowed, his happiness would be
complete indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins whirled around. “Well—p’raps,”
he began slowly. Then he saw
David’s face. “Now I shouldn’t wonder ef
you could before long learn to fill them jugs.
An’ that would be a most dreadful help, David,
for it’s slow work as stock still, I tell you.
Now run along an’ ask your ma ef you can
come an’ help me in th’ store a little now and
then. You never must go into anythin’, you
know, without askin’ her.”</p>

<p>“An’ ef ever I see a boy run,” reported Mr.
Atkins that day at dinner to his wife, “’twas
Davie Pepper, Ma; when I said that, his legs
jest twinkled.” And the storekeeper sat back
in his chair to laugh. He even forgot to ask
for a second helping of pie.</p>

<p>“Mamsie!” Davie sprang into the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
brown house, swinging his bag of Indian meal,
nearly upsetting Phronsie coming to meet him,
Seraphina upside down in her arms.</p>

<p>“Goodness me, Davie!” exclaimed Polly,
coming out of the provision room, the tin pail
of bread in her hand, “what <i>is</i> the matter?”</p>

<p>“Where’s Mamsie?” cried Davie, his blue
eyes shining, and turning a very red face on
her.</p>

<p>“She’s gone to Grandma Bascom’s,” said
Polly, dropping the pail to seize his little calico
blouse, “and do give me that bag, Davie.”</p>

<p>Davie gave up the bag and tore himself away
from Polly’s hold. “I must ask Mamsie,” he
shouted, running to the door.</p>

<p>“My senses!” cried Polly, “what <i>is</i> the
matter?” She wanted to rub her eyes to see if
it really was Davie who stood before her.
“Wait! Mamsie’s coming home in a few minutes.
Why, here she is now!” glancing out
of the window.</p>

<p>David sprang out. “Oh, Mamsie,” he precipitated
himself upon Mother Pepper half-way
up the path. “He wants me to help him, and
I’m going to learn to tie up bundles, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
said he thought some time I could fill molasses
jugs, if you’d say yes. Can’t I, Mamsie?”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” Mrs. Pepper held him by
both little shoulders. “What is it all about,
Davie? No, no, don’t try to speak now,” she
added, seeing his face. “Come in and tell
Mother.”</p>

<p>And pretty soon, over by her big old calico-covered
rocker, the story got out, Polly hanging
over them both, and Phronsie, who had
dropped Seraphina on the way, leaning, perfectly
absorbed, against Mother Pepper’s knee.</p>

<p>“To think of my boy being wanted to help
Mr. Atkins!” cried Mrs. Pepper with shining
eyes. “Oh, Davie!”</p>

<p>“Can I—can I?” cried David, feeling as
if he couldn’t wait another minute for the
“yes” that all his hopes were hanging upon.</p>

<p>“Can you? Yes, yes, Davie.” Mrs. Pepper
gathered him up into her lap. “Oh, what
a help you’ll be to Mother, if you are a good
boy and learn to do everything in the store that
Mr. Atkins tells you!”</p>

<p>Polly ran down the road a good piece to meet
Ben when he came home from Deacon Blodgett’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Joel had scampered on ahead.
“Where are you going?” he had screamed as
Polly flew past.</p>

<p>“Going to walk home with Ben,” she had
shouted, flying along.</p>

<p>“My goodness, Polly,” cried Ben, as she
rushed up to him, “is the house afire?”</p>

<p>“Mercy no!” Polly gasped for breath.
“You can’t think,” she panted.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” Ben pounded her on the back.
“You’re going like a steam engine, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Well, I feel like a steam engine,” said
Polly, with another gasp. “Oh, Ben, you—can’t
ever guess—what’s happened.”</p>

<p>“Come on over here.” Ben dragged her off
to the stone wall. “There now, tell me all
about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, in the first place,” said Polly, sitting
down on the wall, Ben by her side, and drawing
a long breath, “I don’t ever mean to be so
bad as I was this morning, Ben.”</p>

<p>She folded her hands in her lap, and a sorrowful
little look came into her brown eyes.</p>

<p>“You weren’t bad,” contradicted Ben
stoutly; “and anyway, if you were, I was
worse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“Oh, no, Ben,” said Polly quickly; “you are
never as bad as I am, and you always see something
better ahead.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t, Polly,” declared Ben,
“you’re the one to pretend that things are good,
and you have such splendid plans. I never can
think of anything. Well, anyway, tell what’s
happened at home.”</p>

<p>“Ben,” said Polly, suddenly lifting her face,
the color rushing all over it, “just when the
potatoes are all gone, and there isn’t much
bread in the pail, what do you think—you
can’t guess, so I’ll tell you. Mr. Atkins has
asked Davie to come now and then to help him
in his store.”</p>

<p>“Not our Davie!” exclaimed Ben, nearly
tumbling off the stone wall; “why, he’s too
little. You must be dreaming, Polly.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I’m not dreaming,” declared Polly
indignantly; “and Davie wouldn’t ever say
things that aren’t so. You know that, Ben
Pepper.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Ben—but he looked
very puzzled.</p>

<p>“And anyway, even if we don’t understand
it,” said Polly wisely, “why it’s so. And just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
think what a help to Mamsie. And it’s come
when I was so bad this very morning.”</p>

<p>“You weren’t bad,” declared Ben again.
And there they had it all over again.</p>

<p>“But you will be—we shall both be,” he
wound up with a laugh, “if we sit here on this
stone wall much longer.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Polly, with a little laugh,
and hopping off from the wall, they both ran
off, hand in hand, down the road to the little
brown house.</p>

<p>When they got there everything was in a
truly dreadful state. There lay Joel, face
down on the floor, crying as if his heart would
break. “I want to go to help in the store,”
he screamed over and over, till nobody else had
a chance to be heard. David was hanging over
him in the greatest distress, saying, “I won’t
go, Joey—you may go, Joey.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper shook her head, and said
quietly, “Oh, yes, Davie, you must go; you
have promised Mr. Atkins.”</p>

<p>“I want to tie up bundles,” screamed Joel,
kicking his heels on the floor. “O dear—dear—boo—hoo—hoo!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” Davie ran over to Mother Pepper’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
chair, “Mr. Atkins would let Joey come
and help him instead of me,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, Davie,” said Mother Pepper, shaking
her head worse than ever, “Mr. Atkins asked
you, and you have promised. Always remember
a promise once given must be kept,” and
she patted his flushed cheek. “Joel, come
here!” It was impossible for Joel to stay on
the floor kicking his heels and screaming when
Mamsie spoke in that tone, so he got up and
drew slowly near to her, digging his knuckles
into his streaming eyes.</p>

<p>“Davie couldn’t ask Mr. Atkins to let you
take his place, even if he hadn’t promised, for
you are so much bigger than Davie, that he isn’t
strong enough to help Ben pile wood as you do.
Why, you are my big boy, Joey!” She patted
his stubby black hair affectionately.</p>

<p>“So I am,” said Joel, as if a wholly new
idea had struck him, and wiping off the last
tear on the back of his little brown hand.
“You see, I couldn’t go, Dave, instead of you,
to help Mr. Atkins in the store, for I am so
much bigger than you, and I’ve got to pile
wood and help Mamsie.”</p>

<p>Davie drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“So you have,” he said. Then he laughed
gleefully.</p>

<p>“And I’m so hungry,” announced Joel, the
matter all settled now comfortably. “O dear,
isn’t dinner ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Polly, running over to the stove,
“and we’ve got mush to-day—Indian meal
mush—just think. Do get the molasses
pitcher, Ben!”</p>

<p>“No, let me,” begged Davie, all aglow with
the delightful visions of molasses jugs being
filled by his hands from the big barrel in Mr.
Atkins’ store.</p>

<p>“So you may, Davie,” said Polly, putting
the big dish of mush on the table.</p>

<small>HOP O’ MY THUMB</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“NOW, David, ef you warn’t here,” said
Mr. Atkins, “I couldn’t go off this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you, Mr. Atkins?” said David
happily, over in the corner dusting the cans of
peas and beans piled on the shelves, and he
whirled around, the dust-cloth in his hand.</p>

<p>“No, never in all this world,” the storekeeper
smote his hands together smartly.
“Now you see, Davie, <i>what</i> a help you be to
me.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad I’m a help to you, Mr. Atkins,”
cried Davie, the color all over his face, and his
heart going like a trip-hammer.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go over to Simon Beeton’s
farm to see about them potatoes,” said Mr.
Atkins, “for he’d cheat me out of my eye-teeth
ef I bought ’em without seein’. An’ now I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
can leave so easy in my mind, Davie, seein’ you
are here.”</p>

<p>Davie’s bosom swelled, and he stood quite
still. Oh, how glad Mamsie will be! And
how good it was that Mr. Atkins’ eye-teeth
were now not in any danger.</p>

<p>“An’ you can take th’ orders, David,” said
Mr. Atkins, hurrying over to the counter to
pick up the slate; “you can write so nice an’
plain now, that I’ll know all what folks want
when I get back.”</p>

<p>David longed to ask, “Can’t I give ’em the
things they want?” But Mother Pepper had
told him the first morning that he went to the
grocery store, not to ask Mr. Atkins if he
might do anything, but to wait to be told.</p>

<p>“An’ some time—maybe the next time I go
tradin’, you may wait on th’ customers,” said
Mr. Atkins encouragingly, “so you must learn
all you can, David.”</p>

<p>David smothered a sigh, but he stood quite
tall. “I’ll do everything I can, Mr. Atkins,”
he said.</p>

<p>“That’s right, an’ ef anythin’ extry comes
up, you run into th’ house for Mis Atkins.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” promised David, feeling sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
that he would understand if he gave his whole
mind to it.</p>

<p>“Well, I must be off,” cried the storekeeper
with an eye to the old clock on the shelf above
the cans of peas and beans, and the door
slammed as he hurried into the house.</p>

<p>David stood still to draw a long breath and
look around. He was actually left in charge
of Mr. Atkins’ store!</p>

<p>For just one minute he couldn’t believe it,
then the joyful truth rushed over him. He
wanted to run over and practise writing on the
slate just as he had been doing every day when
there wasn’t anything that Mr. Atkins set as a
task. But now to-day it was different.</p>

<p>“You dust down them shelves, Davie,” the
storekeeper had said that very morning, “they
look mortal bad, an’ old Mis Shaw kept starin’
’em all over yest’day, an’ she looked ‘shif’less,’
though she didn’t say it, all th’ time she was
in the store. An’ I’m afraid she’ll think everything
dusty, jest because I hain’t had no time
to move them pesky cans.”</p>

<p>So as dusting the shelves was the task set
for him now, why he must keep at it. And
David turned his back on the beloved slate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
lying on the counter with the slate pencil dangling
off by its string.</p>

<p>“If I could only have a slate all my own,”
said David to himself, as he began again on the
lower shelf, patiently chasing every bit of dust
from it, and moving each tin can carefully to
one side. “Perhaps I will, some time.” He
had finished that shelf and looked up to the
next one. “I must get the step-ladder,” he
said, “for Mr. Atkins told me to dust ’em all.”</p>

<p>And presently he was mounted up there,
dust-cloth in hand, when a voice back of him
called, “Hello—Hello, there!”</p>

<p>David whirled around on his step-ladder.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mr. Atkins?” cried a farmer,
whip in hand, advancing into the store.</p>

<p>“He’s gone to buy potatoes,” said David.</p>

<p>“Well, who’s in charge o’ th’ store?” demanded
the man.</p>

<p>“Mr. Atkins told me to put down on the
slate what people asked for,” said David. He
wanted dreadfully to say that he was in charge
of the store, but Mr. Atkins hadn’t said that.</p>

<p>“Oh—ho!” roared the farmer, throwing
back his head to laugh. “Well, that <i>is</i> a good
one—a little Hop o’ my Thumb like you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Ho—Ho!” David’s cheeks got very hot,
and his small legs trembled under him, as he
got down from the step-ladder, laying his dust-cloth
on the top step, and went over to the
counter.</p>

<p>“Mr. Atkins told me to write down what the
folks wanted,” he repeated, picking up the
slate.</p>

<p>The farmer stopped laughing and drew up
to the counter, looking at him curiously.</p>

<p>“You tell Atkins I’ve got apples as good as
th’ next one, an’ I want he should give me some
money for ’em.”</p>

<p>David drew the slate pencil up into his
fingers. O dear—what was he to write!
This wasn’t anything to do with orders; but the
farmer’s cold eyes were on him, and he was
just getting ready to laugh again, so something
must be done.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked, raising his
blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Jones—Simeon Jones,” said the farmer,
his big mouth twitching under his heavy beard,
as he looked down at the small figure.</p>

<p>David began with a beating heart; but as he
went on he forgot all about the farmer, thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
only of Mamsie. He mustn’t break down,
for if he did, he would get no more chance to
keep store for Mr. Atkins.</p>

<p>“Let’s see what you’ve ben writin’,” Mr.
Jones slouched over the slate, as Davie laid it
on the counter. “Thunder, that ain’t th’ way
to put it.”</p>

<p>“You said you wanted some money,” said
Davie, standing his ground; but his legs
trembled all the same.</p>

<p>Mr. Simeon Jones held up the slate and
squinted at the crooked letters, having hard
work to keep from running into each other.
“Mr. Jones wants you to give him sum munny
for his appuls.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t a-beggin’,” he said, “an’ besides,
he hain’t bought th’ apples yet. I want him to
buy ’em an’ pay me cash down.” He slapped
the counter with his heavy whip, then tucked it
under his arm.</p>

<p>David reached over and got the little sponge
that had wandered off by itself, the storekeeper
declaring it got in the way when it
dangled on the string alongside the slate pencil.
Then he rubbed out everything but “Mr.
Jones,” and began again, the big farmer leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
against the counter to watch the work
go on.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jones wants munny for his appuls.”</p>

<p>“No—no,” roared Mr. Simeon Jones in
such a tone that David, clinging to the slate
pencil, jumped in dismay. “I tell you he hain’t
bought ’em yit. Here, give me that ere slate
an’ I’ll write it myself.”</p>

<p>“No—no,” said David, clutching slate and
pencil and all, and backing off to the end of
the counter. “Mr. Atkins said I was to write
it.” He was in mortal terror that the farmer’s
big hand, now raised, would seize his last
chance of ever being put in trust again in the
store.</p>

<p>But Mr. Simeon Jones, not really being
armed and equipped for much writing, either
on a slate or on anything else, decided that he
didn’t care to undertake any job along that
line; so his big hand dropped.</p>

<p>“Well, you write it as I tell you,” he commanded
gruffly, “or you won’t get no jobs in
this store, when I tell Atkins.”</p>

<p>Which being exactly what David was terrified
about, he began once more: “Mr. Jones
wants you to bi his appuls—and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Pay him cash,” shouted the farmer over
David’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Pay him Kash,” finished David, the pencil
trembling in fear of more messages to follow.</p>

<p>“That will do,” said Mr. Jones, quite mollified;
“it’ll clinch the business.” Then he drew
off and looked at David tucking the slate in its
place on the counter. “Say—did you mind
when I laughed at you?”</p>

<p>David wanted dreadfully to stand up like a
man and say “No,” but Mother Pepper had
said, “always tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said slowly, “I did.”</p>

<p>“Thunderation!” exploded the farmer, and
a dull red crept up into his swarthy cheek; one
of his big hands went into his pocket. “There,
I ain’t a-goin’ to laugh at you no more,” and he
held out a coin. “You’re a real smart boy ef
you ain’t any bigger’n a pint o’ cider. There’s
a dime for ye.”</p>

<p>David jumped back as if shot, and put his
hands behind him.</p>

<p>“Take it,” urged Mr. Simeon Jones, pushing
the dime nearer.</p>

<p>“Mamsie wouldn’t like it,” was all that
Davie could manage to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Mamsie—who’s him?” demanded the
farmer.</p>

<p>“She’s our mother,” said Davie, keeping his
hands behind him.</p>

<p>“Saltpeter!” ejaculated Mr. Simeon Jones;
“well then I s’pose you can’t take this ’ere
dime, ef she wouldn’t like it, eh?”</p>

<p>“No,” said David, quite happy that he was
at last understood.</p>

<p>“Well, I shall tell Atkins you’ve done fust-rate,”
said the farmer, slouching to the door.
Then he went out with another curious look at
David, got into his big wagon and drove off.</p>

<p>Davie went back to the step-ladder, climbed
up and wiped all the shelves. He wanted to
sing, but that wasn’t the way, he was quite sure,
to keep a grocery store. So he shut his lips
tightly together, but his blue eyes shone as the
dust-cloth went busily on its way into all the
corners. At last it was all done, and every one
of the tin cans of peas and beans in neat rows
were in their places. Then he got down from
the step-ladder and gazed at them all in great
delight.</p>

<p>“Now I can practise my writing on the
slate,” he cried joyfully. And scampering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
over to a barrel of sugar standing by the counter,
he got on it, slate in hand, and fell to
laboriously forming all the best letters that
Polly had showed him how to make.</p>

<p>“I must be careful not to rub out ‘Mr.
Jones,’” he said. So he laid a paper lying on
the counter ready for a bundle to be tied up,
between the farmer’s message and his knees,
and presently he was lost to all but the blissful
prospect of some time being able to write things
as beautifully as Polly herself.</p>

<p>The first thing he knew the door to the grocery
store was slowly opened, and Davie lifted
his head.</p>

<p>A young man stepped softly in. He wasn’t
the kind that was seen around Badgertown, and
Davie didn’t like his looks in the least.</p>

<p>“Well, old man,” said the newcomer, drawing
near to David’s barrel and looking him all
over with a pair of evil eyes, “where’s the
boss?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said David.</p>

<p>“Why, the boss who runs this store,” the
young man flirted a pair of long and grimy
fingers comprehensively.</p>

<p>“He isn’t here,” said David, not taking his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
blue eyes from the face that now he liked less
than ever.</p>

<p>“And he’s left you to take charge of the she-bang?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that is,” said David.</p>

<p>“The store—the store,” the visitor cried
impatiently, and threw his dirty fingers about
more recklessly than ever. Then he snapped
them in David’s face.</p>

<p>“He told me to write things that folks asked
for on the slate,” said David.</p>

<p>The young man broke into a laugh as much
more unpleasant than that of Mr. Simeon Jones
as could be imagined. Then he broke off suddenly
to listen. “Somebody might be passing,”
he muttered. “See here, old man, there
wasn’t any need for you to tell me about your
boss. I saw him drive away and I was coming
in then to pay you a call; thought you might be
lonesome,” and he chuckled under his breath;
“then that other old party hove along, so I
couldn’t get here till now. Look here!” It
was impossible for Davie to obey this command
any better, for he had never taken his
blue eyes from the face, now just above him,
as he sat on the barrel, slate in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“I ain’t going to have any fooling,” the
young man was saying between his teeth, and
he raised one hand threateningly. “I’ll tell
you that to begin with—I’ve come here for
money. You can’t help yourself, for the boss
is away.”</p>

<p>He put both dirty hands on the counter and
vaulting over it, twitched open the drawer to
rummage in the till.</p>

<p>Davie sprang down from his barrel. “You
mustn’t do that,” he screamed, “that’s Mr.
Atkins’ money.”</p>

<p>“You shut your gab.” The young man, one
fist full of silver pieces and pennies, raised his
head, his wicked eyes sparkling in anger.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t take it! It’s Mr. Atkins’
money!” David, his heart going like everything,
beat on the counter with one small hand.
Oh, if some customer would only come in!</p>

<p>“See here—you’ll get the worst beating
you ever had,” declared the young man, “if
you don’t hold your tongue.” He hissed out
the last words and bent over the till again.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="illus_fp188">

<p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">He told me to write things that folks asked for on the

</figure>

<p>David, in mortal terror that whatever he did,
he couldn’t keep Mr. Atkins’ money from being
carried off, cast another imploring glance at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
door for a possible customer. No one was in
sight, Badgertown street in front of the store
being free from all pedestrians, and there
wasn’t a wagon to be seen. Then Mr. Atkins’
words flashed upon him, “If anythin’ extry
comes up, you run into the house for Mis Atkins.”</p>

<p>This was certainly “somethin’ extry,” and it
was quite time to run into the house and call
Mrs. Atkins. He made one leap for the little
door that shut off the storekeeper’s home, and
the first thing he knew, he was seized violently
from behind and thrown in a heap to the
floor.</p>

<p>David could not hear the words—he only
knew that the awful eyes were glaring at him,
and he shut his own so that he could not see,
as the young man hissed out something. At
last he made out, “No, you don’t, my fine sir.
I’ll attend to you before I go.” Then he
was dragged off to a corner, thrown behind
some bags of oats, and tied fast to a rope
hanging from the neck of one. “I guess you
won’t run much with one of them bags at your
heels,” and the young man surveyed his work
with a grin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Da—<i>vid</i>!” rang out the voice of Mrs.
Atkins. “Where are you?”</p>

<p>The young man on his way back to the till
started and pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>“Oh,—she’ll be killed!” David screamed.
“Don’t come in!” The little door was flung
wide, and Mrs. Atkins, all in a hurry as dinner
was waiting, got herself into the store just in
time to see a tall figure flying past and out into
Badgertown street.</p>

<p>“My sakes!” she ejaculated. Then she
gave a wild look around. “David, where be
ye?”</p>

<p>“Here,” said David, behind the bags of oats.
“Oh, Mrs. Atkins, did he take any?”</p>

<p>“For th’ land sakes—David Pepper!”
The storekeeper’s wife knelt down by his side.
When she saw the rope she was quite overcome,
and she fumbled helplessly at the knots.</p>

<p>“Did he—did he?” implored Davie in
great distress, “take any of Mr. Atkins’
money?”</p>

<p>“Money?” Mrs. Atkins hopped to her feet
in great alarm, and scuttled over to get behind
the counter. “My soul an’ body!” she exclaimed,
pawing among the loose dimes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
nickels and pennies dropped by the young man
when he sprang for David.</p>

<p>“Did he?” implored Davie. “Oh, do tell
me, Mrs. Atkins—did he take any money?”</p>

<p>“It looks as if he’d ben interrupted.” The
storekeeper’s wife drew a long sigh of relief,
as she settled the coins back into the till, and
slammed to the drawer. “I don’t b’lieve he
got a single cent, David Pepper,” she said,
coming back to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad,” said Davie.</p>

<p>“An’ now I’ll untie you,” she said, getting
down on her knees. “My gracious!” and she
shook with fright, “sech a risk as you’ve
run!”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad he didn’t get any money,”
breathed Davie blissfully.</p>

<p>“An’ you’ve saved it,” Mrs. Atkins, getting
the last knot out, threw the end of the ropes
off, “just think of that, David Pepper!”</p>

<p>David’s blue eyes shone. “I wish I could
have kept him,” he said, as he got up to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Land!—don’t say that—you’ve done
splendid!” said Mrs. Atkins, and she shivered
as she got up.</p>

<small>“DON’T HURT HIM”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. ATKINS ran to the door. “Beats
all how a man ain’t never on hand when
he’s wanted,” she exclaimed in vexation, peering
up and down the street.</p>

<p>“Well, now, ef here ain’t Mr. Jones heavin’
along,” she cried joyfully, and picking up her
calico gown, she sped over the step, bawling
out, “Do stop—Mr. Jones!”</p>

<p>“What’s th’ matter, Mis Atkins?” asked the
farmer leisurely driving up.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, only do get out,” she cried
excitedly.</p>

<p>“Hain’t nothin’ happened to that little feller,
has they?” the farmer pointed his thumb in
great concern toward the store.</p>

<p>“No—no—but ef it hadn’t ben for Davie,
Mr. Atkins would ’a’ ben robbed,” declared
Mrs. Atkins; then she thrust her head back into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
the store, “Davie, come here, an’ tell us all
about it. We must catch th’ man, or he’ll try it
again, like enough.”</p>

<p>“Sho!” exclaimed Farmer Jones, as Davie
ran out to the step. Then he whistled,
“Whew! Hop o’ my Thumb,” he was going
to say. But remembering how the small boy
hadn’t liked that, nor the laugh, he whistled
again, as he got slowly out of the wagon.</p>

<p>“Tell it, Davie,” Mrs. Atkins kept saying,
“just exactly how it all happened.” And then
a small knot of farmers drew near, so there was
quite a little crowd.</p>

<p>As Davie forgot to say much about himself,
Mrs. Atkins and Farmer Jones were
obliged to prod him with questions. At last
the story was pieced out.</p>

<p>“We must catch the fellow,” exclaimed one
farmer, “else he’ll be trying the same game
again.”</p>

<p>“Like enough we’ll be murdered in our
beds,” said a woman, pushing her way into
the center of things, “an’ ’twon’t be safe to
live in Badgertown.”</p>

<p>And a thin voice on the fringe of the crowd
piped out, “I warrant it’s the same man that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
stopped to my house this mornin’ for somethin’
to eat.”</p>

<p>“What did he look like, Grandsir Tibbs?”
cried two or three.</p>

<p>“I dunno no more’n th’ dead,” said Grandsir
querulously. His voice shook worse than ever,
under the excitement of the thing. “His cap
was drawed over his face—I shet th’ door on
him.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to catch th’ feller,” declared
a stalwart farmer, “an’ this boy,” laying
his hand on David’s small shoulder, “is th’
only one who knows what th’ tramp looks like.
Come on, youngster,” and before he knew what
was going to happen, Davie was lifted up and
dumped into a wagon, the owner jumping in
and gathering up the reins.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried the storekeeper’s wife, when
she saw this, trying to break through the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Catch th’ feller—come on—” the cry
was taken up, and the other farmers in the
wagons drove off after the one carrying Davie,
Mrs. Atkins running along as far as her breath
would permit, crying, “Stop—you mustn’t—take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
th’ boy! He’s David Pepper,” and sometimes
she said, “He’s Mis Pepper’s boy.” But
no matter how she screamed it, the wagons
rolled on, and at last she sank down by the
roadside.</p>

<p>“He’d take to th’ woods mos’ likely,” said
the farmer who had David as a companion and
thus was the leader, pointing off with his whip
as he stood up in the wagon and looked back at
the procession.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” they called back. So to the
woods they whipped up.</p>

<p>When they drew up to a thick grove of pines
skirting Badgertown, they all tumbled out of
the wagons and peered cautiously in.</p>

<p>“One of us must set out here with th’ boy—we
ain’t a-goin’ to drag him in.”</p>

<p>“I’ll set,” offered one man, coming up to
Davie’s wagon.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you’d offer,” said the farmer
to whom that vehicle belonged, “but all th’
same, you ain’t a-goin’ to have that easy part.
Simeon Jones—you come an’ take keer o’ this
boy, will you, till we fetch out th’ feller?”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Farmer Jones, driving up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
“Come, git in here;” he again came perilously
near to saying “Hop o’ my Thumb,” but he
coughed and just saved himself.</p>

<p>David, being in that position where there
was nothing to do but to obey, jumped out of
his wagon and into that of Farmer Jones, who
received him gladly.</p>

<p>“Sho now!” began Mr. Jones, clearing his
throat, “th’ tramp robbed Mr. Atkins—eh?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t get any money,” said David,
folding his small hands.</p>

<p>“That’s good!” cried Farmer Jones, slapping
his leg. “Well, I ’spect you kept him
from it,” he said, looking down admiringly at
the little figure on the other half of the old
leather seat. “Gosh! You ain’t bigger’n a
half a pint o’ cider, but I b’lieve you did it—eh?”</p>

<p>David fought shy of this question and said
nothing. But it was no use. By little and
little, Farmer Jones, being a man who, to put
it into his own words, “stuck to a thing like
an old dog to a bone,” wormed the story out
of David, helplessly miserable at being obliged
to tell it.</p>

<p>Suddenly the body of Badgertown citizens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
trooped out from the woods. In the midst of
them was the young man with the evil eyes,
who had visited Mr. Atkins’ store.</p>

<p>Everybody was shouting in chorus, and
Farmer Jones clapped Davie’s shoulder with a
glad hand. “Say, youngster, that’s th’ feller,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>David drew a long breath. But Mamsie,
having often said, “Tell the truth,” he said,
“Yes.” And one of the young farmers, finding
the capture a trifle dull, crowded roughly
up against the prisoner. This was the signal
for the others, who began to wreak a little of
the vengeance to come upon their man.</p>

<p>David stood straight up in the wagon.
“Don’t hurt him,” he begged.</p>

<p>The young man with the evil eyes turned
them upon Davie; but he said nothing.</p>

<p>“Easy there,” commanded Farmer Jones.</p>

<p>“We don’t want such fellers comin’ to
Badgertown,” said the first young farmer.
“Come on, boys, we must give him a hustle
before we fetch him to Cherryville jail.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t hurt him,” said Davie in a
loud voice. His cheeks were very red, and his
blue eyes flashed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“What this boy says, goes,” cried Farmer
Jones sharply. “D’ye understand?”</p>

<p>They did, Simeon Jones being a person to be
reckoned with. And pretty soon the young
man who had visited Mr. Atkins’ store had his
hands neatly tied together with a piece of rope,
and he found himself in a wagon, the horse
being turned to the road leading to Cherryville
jail.</p>

<p>“You tell that boy,” he nodded his head
over toward David, “that ’tain’t his fault that
I’m took, an’ I’m obliged to him for trying to
save me.”</p>

<p>But David burst into tears and flung himself
down on the floor of the wagon.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to hurry back and lock up th’
store,” Mrs. Atkins was saying about this time,
getting up from the roadside, “an’ then I must
get over to Mis Pepper’s an’ tell her all about
it. Goodness me—how’ll I ever do it?”</p>

<p>But Mother Pepper had the news before the
storekeeper’s wife reached the little brown
house, for Davie was there. Farmer Simeon
Jones, aghast at the flood of tears, had hurried
him home as fast as the old horse could go.</p>

<p>“Your Ma’ll say you done right,” he kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
repeating over and over. “Don’t you be
afeard. An’ th’ man ain’t goin’ to be hurt.
An’ they give real good meals, I’ve heard say,
over to Cherryville jail.”</p>

<p>But all this was no comfort to David, and he
wailed steadily on.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blest ef I ain’t glad to see that
’ere little brown house,” declared Mr. Jones,
very spry at getting out as the old horse
stopped at the gate. David, half blinded by
his tears, stumbled out and up to the big green
door. Mother Pepper opened it. “I couldn’t
help it, Mamsie,” he cried, huddling into her
arms.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye, Marm,” said Farmer Jones,
looking into her black eyes, “fust go-off, so’s
you needn’t to worry. This boy o’ yourn has
done just fine.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it, Mamsie,” Davie kept
saying.</p>

<p>“There—there—Davie—” Mother Pepper
held him closely, while one hand patted his
soft light hair; then she looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Simeon Jones is my name, Marm,” said the
farmer. “Might I come in—it’s kinder a
long story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Yes, indeed,” and once in the old kitchen,
the farmer’s tongue took up the tale and ran it
off glibly. And just at the very end in hurried
the storekeeper’s wife.</p>

<p>“Now, Davie,” said Mother Pepper, when
at last it was all out, “you did just right.”
How her black eyes shone! And she kissed his
hot cheek.</p>

<p>“But the poor man—he’s in jail,” moaned
David.</p>

<p>“That had to be,” said Mrs. Pepper firmly.
“Don’t you see, child, if he were allowed to go
free, Badgertown people wouldn’t be safe from
robbers.”</p>

<p>“Mamsie, I don’t believe he’s going to steal
any more,” said David, wiping up, the comfort
settling down into his heart, since Mamsie
had said it had to be.</p>

<p>“We will hope not,” said Mother Pepper,
with another kiss.</p>

<p>“Hoh!” Joel rushed in, his black eyes
ablaze and his cheeks as red as could be. He
had heard the story at Deacon Blodgett’s, for
all Badgertown was afire with it. “If I’d been
there, I’d ’a’ smashed that old burglar.” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
doubled up his small fists and swung them in
the air.</p>

<p>“Joel—Joel—” said Mrs. Pepper reprovingly.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Farmer Jones, slapping
his thigh.</p>

<p>Joel rushed up to him. “Well, I would,”
he cried. “You needn’t laugh, you, Mr.
Man.”</p>

<p>“Joel, come here.” When Mother Pepper
spoke in that tone there could be no delay.
So up to her chair he marched, yet he had a
backward eye on that old farmer who sat in
that chair laughing at him.</p>

<p>“You’re pretty smart, Joel,” said the storekeeper’s
wife, “but Davie did the best after
all.”</p>

<p>“But I could ’a’ smashed him,” declared
Joel, transferring his attention to her, “if I’d
only been there. Why ain’t I ever there when
a burglar comes,” he cried in anguish. “Why
ain’t I, Mamsie?”</p>

<p>“Well, I must be a-goin’,” said Farmer
Jones, getting out of his chair. “You’ve got
two smart likely boys, Mis Pepper, but the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
un is the most to my taste. Ef you’re goin’
home, Mis Atkins, I’ll take you back.”</p>

<p>“I’m obliged enough, I can tell you,” said
Mrs. Atkins, “for I hain’t run an’ ben scared
to death in a long spell like I’ve ben to-day.
Good-by, David. You’ve took care of our
store every bit as good as a man.”</p>

<p>Davie kept in the little brown house for days
after that; nothing could persuade him to venture
on Badgertown streets, where the folks
were likely to waylay him, and want to know
all about his adventure in Mr. Atkins’ store.
And when any one came to the little brown
house, as many did, to hear all about it, Davie
would run out and hide behind the wood-pile
until they had gone.</p>

<p>“You can’t do that all the time, Davie,”
said Polly one day, finding him there. “I’m
going down to Mr. Beebe to get him to mend
Mamsie’s shoes, and you come with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t, Polly,” said Davie, shrinking
back; yet his blue eyes were full of longing.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Polly gayly.
“Come along, I’ll race you to the gate.”</p>

<p>That was beyond Davie’s resistance. To
race Polly was the children’s great delight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
So off they ran, and as luck would have it,
David got to the gate first.</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” declared Polly, tossing back
her hair from her rosy cheeks. “Well, now,
come on for another spin.”</p>

<p>They had almost reached Mr. Beebe’s little
shop when an old lady coming out of a shop
opposite beckoned violently with her black satin
parasol. The long fringe waved back and
forth as she shook the parasol with an air of
command.</p>

<p>“It is Miss Parrott,” said Polly in an awe-struck
voice. “You go in to Mr. Beebe’s shop
and I’ll run across to her.”</p>

<p>Davie, quite glad to escape and especially
into dear Mr. Beebe’s shoe-shop, hurried over
the cobble-stones, while Polly flew across the
street. His foot was on the step, when a voice
said: “Bring the boy—he’s the one I want
to see.”</p>

<p>“You will have to come, Davie,” said Polly,
hurrying back.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t,” said Davie, crowding up
against the shoe-shop door; “don’t make me,
Polly.” He turned a distressed little face as
she hurried up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Yes, you must,” said Polly. “Mamsie
would say so.”</p>

<p>“Would Mamsie say so?” cried Davie,
hanging to the big knocker. “Would she
really, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Polly, “she would. Come on,
Davie,” and she held out her hand. So together
they went across the narrow little street,
David hanging back on lagging footsteps.</p>

<p>Miss Parrott’s big coach was around the
corner. There she stood now, waiting for
them.</p>

<p>“I want to hear all about what happened
yesterday in Mr. Atkins’ store,” she said,
“and I am going to take you two children to
drive, and then, David, you can tell me the
story on the way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Parrott,” cried Polly, dismayed
at Davie’s frantic clutch on her hand, “I have
to take Mamsie’s shoes for Mr. Beebe to
mend.” Yet her eyes sparkled at the very
thought of riding in that Parrott grand coach!</p>

<p>“Run across then with them,” said Miss
Parrott. “Come, David, you and I will get
into the carriage, and Polly will join us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the shoes over to Mr. Beebe,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
cried Davie frantically, and he reached for
Polly’s bundle.</p>

<p>“No, David,” said Miss Parrott, “Polly
must do it. You come with me.” And there
he was, his little hand in hers, on the way to the
coach waiting around the corner, and Polly
flying across the street to the little shoe-shop
just as frantic to get back to him.</p>

<p>“Now then, we can be quite comfortable,”
said Miss Parrott, having them all settled in
the big stately old coach, the order to drive
given to the coachman, who matched up in
dignity to the coach and the Parrott estate,
“and you shall give me the whole story. Begin
at the beginning, David.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>IN THE PARROTT PLAYROOM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MISS PARROTT looked the two children
over carefully. Then her glance rested
on David. He sat tucked up in the corner of
the green-leather seat, as far away from the
keen dark eyes as he could get, his hand tightly
clasped in Polly’s.</p>

<p>“Now then,” said Miss Parrott, the investigation
being over, “you must tell me everything
about it. I was unable to get a satisfactory
account at Atkins’ store. Begin, little
boy.”</p>

<p>Davie gave a sob, and ducked farther back
into his corner. This was so much worse than
being waylaid for a recital of his adventure by
the ordinary run of Badgertown citizens, that
he couldn’t conceal his dismay. To think of
being fastened up in the Parrott coach and
made to tell of what was now a perfectly hateful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
thing since he was to be petted and praised
for his part in it, made him sob again; and he
flung himself up against Polly and hid his
burning face on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Parrott,” Polly broke out,
“Davie cannot bear to talk about it. He only
did what he ought to.” She forgot that she
was talking to the aristocratic lady, whose comings
and goings in this same stately coach to
the little church on Badgertown green were
eagerly watched for of a Sunday. She raised
her brown eyes pleadingly.</p>

<p>“That is where you are very wrong to encourage
your little brother in refusing to answer
my questions. And I must insist on
knowing all about what happened.” The tall
aristocratic figure on the seat opposite loomed
up so forbiddingly that Polly had all she could
do to keep from joining in Davie’s distress.
But this would never do. Besides, Miss Parrott
was saying, “I am sure your mother,
whom I have heard brings you children up
most excellently, would wish your little brother
to answer my questions.”</p>

<p>“Davie,” said Polly desperately, bending her
head down to his ear, “you must sit up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
tell Miss Parrott about it. Mamsie would
want you to.”</p>

<p>She had to say it over three times, “Mamsie
would want you to,” for instead of sitting up,
Davie burrowed deeper against her shoulder.
At last her tone was so decided, that anything
being more desirable than to lose Polly’s approval,
David somehow got up into a sitting
posture; and before he quite knew what he was
going to say, there he was doing his best to
let Miss Parrott understand just what happened
in Mr. Atkins’ store. He must please
Mamsie.</p>

<p>And to his great surprise and relief, Miss
Parrott never said one word of praise for anything
that he did, and as for petting him, she
still sat bolt upright at the conclusion of the
tale, and only said, “Thank you for telling
me.”</p>

<p>David drew himself up, and began to enjoy
himself. As for Polly, her brown eyes danced
and the color came back in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I am going to take you home with me,”
said Miss Parrott suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Polly, wrenched away from the
bliss of actually driving in the Parrott coach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
“we can’t go. Mamsie doesn’t know where
we are, and we ought to go home now.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Miss Parrott reflectively,
“that I ought to drive around and ask your
mother.” But she bit her lip, being accustomed
to do all things as she chose without
leave or license from anybody. Still a woman
should be asked about the movements of her
own children. So she gave the order to the
old coachman, and the horses were soon turned
in the direction of the little brown house.</p>

<p>Davie forgot himself and sprang out without
a word of thanks, and rushed up to the old
green door.</p>

<p>“Oh, do forgive him, Miss Parrott,” begged
Polly in distress, “he didn’t mean to be rude.”</p>

<p>For answer Miss Parrott only said, “Will
you ask your mother to come out here?” But
she smiled, so Polly knew that things weren’t so
very bad, and she ran up the path, greatly relieved.</p>

<p>And presently Mrs. Pepper came out, with
Polly, and to the great astonishment, said,
“Yes, the children could go,” and “Run in,
and put a clean blouse on, Davie.”</p>

<p>“The boy looks well enough,” said Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Parrott decidedly. “I’m sure you keep your
children always clean, Mrs. Pepper,—everybody
says so.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Pepper only smiled, and Polly ran
into the house to get Davie ready. For when
Mamsie said a thing, she always meant it, and
pretty soon out they came, Davie quite fresh
in another calico blouse and not entirely at rest
in his mind as to the visit at the Parrott estate.</p>

<p>When they drove up with a flourish before
the big front door with carved stone lions on
either side, Davie held Polly’s hand closely, and
surveyed everything with wide blue eyes.</p>

<p>The butler, a dignitary resplendent enough
in the children’s eyes to be the owner of many
estates, came down the wide hall. Miss Parrott
gave him instructions concerning her
guests, whom he viewed with cold unconcern.</p>

<p>“Now, then, children,” she said, “I’m going
to take you into the garden and leave you there.
You will be called when luncheon is served,”
and turning off from the big hall to a narrow
passage, they came to a green lattice door.</p>

<p>Miss Parrott opened this. “Oh!” cried
Polly, clasping her hands in delight. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Davie forgot his fright and gave a little squeal.</p>

<p>“It’s so perfectly beautiful!” exclaimed
Polly.</p>

<p>An old-fashioned garden, bright with hollyhocks
and all sorts of dear, homely flowers, a
little square plot in the center, around which
were stone seats, burst upon their view. All
off in the distance were terraces and lawns,
with all manner of splendid trees, and pleasant
paths intersecting.</p>

<p>Miss Parrott’s long gaunt face drew up into
a pleasant smile that seemed to say, “Good-by
to your wrinkles.”</p>

<p>“Now run along, children, and enjoy yourselves,”
she said. “You will be called when
luncheon is ready. Be sure that you come in
at once.”</p>

<p>“Polly,” said Davie in an awe-struck voice,
“do you suppose the lady can come in here
every time she wants to?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Polly, longing to hop
up and down, but perhaps some one would see
her and it wouldn’t be considered proper.
“Why, she lives here, Davie.”</p>

<p>Davie drew a long breath. To live in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
beautiful place and come out in this wonderful
garden! He drew a long breath and stood
quite still beside the green lattice door.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and sit down on one of those little
stone seats,” said Polly.</p>

<p>So the children walked quite properly over
and sat down on one of the seats in the little
green square.</p>

<p>“Polly,” said Davie, “I very much wish
that we could go over under those trees,” pointing
to a bit of greensward where the noonday
sun was making cool shadows.</p>

<p>“Why, we can,” said Polly; “Miss Parrott
said we could run about and enjoy it all.” She
got off from the little stone seat and held out
her hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, Polly, can we really run?” cried Davie
in great excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” cried Polly, finding her courage
in David’s happiness. “Come on, I’ll race
you to that big pine-tree.”</p>

<p>“Now what does Miss Parrott want with the
likes of them poor children,” exclaimed a
scornful housemaid, peering out of the green
lattice door.</p>

<p>“Hevin knows!” cried the butler, raising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
both hands, “and they are actually to stay to
luncheon.”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh!” ejaculated the housemaid with
a sniff.</p>

<p>Up-stairs under the gambrel roof overrun
with sweet-brier, Miss Parrott was sitting by
her window, listening to the childish peals of
laughter, as Polly and David played hide-and-seek
between the ancestral trees.</p>

<p>“I haven’t felt so happy here,” placing her
hand on her heart, “since Sister and I played
there. Strange that I dreaded asking children
here.”</p>

<p>The butler flung open the green lattice door,
and said harshly, “Come in to luncheon,” and
started to find Miss Parrott just behind him.</p>

<p>“That is scarcely the way to summon my
guests,” she said.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, Ma’am,” said the butler obsequiously.</p>

<p>“I want you to go out and treat them as you
would any other of my friends,” said Miss
Parrott.</p>

<p>And the butler with a sullen face but a back
that expressed nothing but complete submission,
stalked down the garden path to the big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
trees whence the happy sounds proceeded.
And the scornful housemaid confided it all to
the equally disdainful cook, who said never
in her twenty-five years of service on the Parrott
estate had she seen such goings on.</p>

<p>When the three were seated around the
luncheon table in the handsome dining-room,
Davie was quite overwhelmed at the array of
silver and glass that shone upon the polished
mahogany table. And Polly turned pale and
only hoped they should neither of them do
anything to disgrace Mamsie.</p>

<p>But although they didn’t know what to do
with all the knives and forks, Miss Parrott
never appeared to notice. Polly, who hadn’t
been able to forget the disdainful butler, saw
him back of Davie’s chair scornfully survey the
efforts to carry the food up nicely to the small
mouth and the color flew over her cheek.
Then Miss Parrott said to him, “I sha’n’t require
you any more. Bring me the bell—and
I will ring if I need you.”</p>

<p>And the butler quite humble once more,
brought the little silver bell from the massive
sideboard heavy with ancestral plate, and went
out of the room, his head lowered by several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
inches. Polly’s hot flush died down on her
cheek, and things began to get comfortable.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Miss Parrott, when luncheon
was over, “I am going to show you some
things that I played with when I was a little
girl.” She had a faint pink color on her sallow
face, and she smiled as if quite content.
But still she didn’t know what to do with her
guests to make them happy.</p>

<p>David wanted to ask, “Were you ever a
little girl?” as he looked the long, angular
figure up and down, but he kept quite still.</p>

<p>“Oh, would you really?” cried Polly in delight.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Miss Parrott, greatly pleased,
“would you really like to see them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we would—we would!” declared
Polly.</p>

<p>“Come this way then,” and out into the big
wide hall, and over a broad and winding staircase
dim with the shaded light of a tall Colonial
window, they went, then down a narrow passage,
at the end of which were two cunning
little steps.</p>

<p>“Here was our playroom—Sister’s and
mine,” said Miss Parrott, pausing at a door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and taking a key from her black silk bag, she
fitted it in the lock. And presently there they
all three were in a long, low-ceilinged room.
It had shelves on two sides filled with books
and games, and dolls—and there was a small
table in the center, and little chairs scattered
about.</p>

<p>Miss Parrott turned her back on it suddenly,
and made as if she were going out. But she
faced the children in a minute and smiled, and
again she put her hand to her heart.</p>

<p>“Now you can each pick out something, and
I will tell you about it,” she said, seating herself
on an old-fashioned broad sofa.</p>

<p>Polly stood quite still before her with shining
eyes. “Can we really touch the things?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, all you like,” and Miss Parrott actually
laughed.</p>

<p>“Davie,” Polly ran up to him, “we can
choose something and take it to her and she
will tell us about it,” she said. Then she ran
off to the corner where the dolls sat up in all
their faded and old-fashioned glory.</p>

<p>David went over to one of the book-shelves.
At first he only gazed; then he put a timid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
finger on one and another. At last he selected
a worn old reader whose pages were interspersed
with pictures, and holding it closely,
he marched up with it to Miss Parrott’s sofa,
just as Polly came flying up with a big rag doll
in a little checked silk gown, a quaint neckerchief,
and a big mob-cap.</p>

<p>“I will tell you about yours first,” said Miss
Parrott, taking the doll. Then she laughed,
“Well, you see Sister and I both had the promise
of a new doll. We were to own it together,
because that was the way we had everything,”
and she waved her hand around the playroom.
“Well, our mother had given the order
to have it made and dressed, and its face
was to be painted by a real artist. Oh, you
can’t think how we watched for that doll.
We were quite impatient for its arrival. The
lady who was to dress it kept sending word
that she had been detained from doing the
work, but that it was to be quite fine. We
were letting our imaginations run riot with
all sorts of splendid ideas on just how that doll
was to look. Sister decided it would be
dressed in a pink satin gown with a little pink
cap,—but I hoped it would be all in blue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
Well, we used to watch at the window, a part
of every day for the big box containing that
precious doll.</p>

<p>“At last one day Sister was at the window,
and she screamed ‘Judith—Judith!’”</p>

<p>Davie forgot his awe, to burst out, “Was
that your name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Miss Parrott, very much
pleased that he had found his tongue. “I was
named for my grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said David.</p>

<p>“And Sarah was my sister’s name; she was
named for our mother.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said David again.</p>

<p>“Well, we ran after the big box as it was
carried into the sitting-room, and Mother had
one of the maids cut the heavy cord and then
Sister and I were each to lift one end of the
cover and take it off. You can’t imagine,
children, what that moment, so long waited for,
was to us!”</p>

<p>Polly and Davie each side of Miss Parrott,
the big rag doll on her lap, didn’t dare to
breathe, so afraid they should miss something
of this great moment.</p>

<p>“We lifted the tissue paper with trembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
fingers, and there lay this doll,” Miss Parrott
lifted it, “and we had watched every day for
a pink or a blue satin one!”</p>

<p>Polly broke the silence first. “Oh, I think
this one was the nicest to play with.”</p>

<p>“So it was, child, but we were silly little
girls, and we had set our hearts on quite
another kind of doll. Well, what do you think
we did? I am quite ashamed to tell you, but
you shall have the whole story. We threw
ourselves down on the floor, our arms around
each other, and declared we didn’t want that
doll.”</p>

<p>“O dear!” exclaimed Polly.</p>

<p>“And so our mother said ‘Very well,’ and
she had the tissue paper all put back over the
doll, the cover put on and the box tied up.
And then it was taken away and put up on a
shelf over the linen press.”</p>

<p>“O dear!” breathed Polly again.</p>

<p>“And that doll stayed up there all one year,
and we never said we were sorry, and asked
for her. And one day an awkward servant in
cleaning that shelf, knocked the box off, and
then he became frightened, so he opened it to
see if he’d broken anything. And somebody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
calling him, he left the box on the floor, and a
little dog we had, a mischievous creature, ran
into the linen-room and stuck his nose in the
box.”</p>

<p>“O dear!” exclaimed Polly and David together.</p>

<p>“And Towsle—”</p>

<p>“Was that his name?” asked Davie, pressing
up to her black silk gown in great excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Miss Parrott, smiling
down into his blue eyes. “Well, Towsle
nipped that doll up in his sharp teeth, and ran
off down-stairs with her. And Sister heard
him coming and she called ‘Towsle—Towsle’
for she wanted him to come and play with her.
But Towsle was going to have a great deal
more pleasure he thought with the doll, so he
hid behind one of the big carved chairs in the
hall. And then when he thought she had gone
safely by, he crept out. But she spied him,
and she screamed, ‘Oh, he’s got our doll!’ and
Uncle John, who was in the sitting-room with
Mother, ran out with her. But Towsle—oh,
there was no catching him then, for—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“And didn’t they catch him?” burst in
Davie with round blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, dear,” Miss Parrott pointed to
the doll in her lap.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Davie with a sigh of relief,
looking down at it.</p>

<p>“But in flying down the long steps at last,
Towsle caught one of his feet in the doll’s
dress, and over he rolled from the top to the
bottom. But he wouldn’t give up the doll.
And then I heard the noise, and I ran out from
the garden, and before Mother and Uncle John
and Sister got there, I seized the doll, and
Towsle pulled and I pulled—and there,” Miss
Parrott turned the doll over in her lap, “the
silk gown was torn. You can scarcely see the
place, for our mother mended it so neatly.”</p>

<p>The Pepper children bent over to scan
closely the rent in the back of the checked silk
gown.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t know it was mended,” declared
Polly at last.</p>

<p>“No, would you?” said Miss Parrott, with
bright eyes. “Our mother was a most beautiful
sewer. Well, we couldn’t help laughing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Towsle was so funny, and he tried to get that
doll away from me after I had at last torn it
from him. And then Sister cried right out,
‘Oh, our <i>poor</i> doll!’—and then I cried over
her, and we petted her up. And we said we’d
love her forever after.”</p>

<p>“That was nice,” said Polly, smoothing
down her gown in great satisfaction.</p>

<p>“And we called her ‘Priscilla,’ and we took
her to bed with us every night,” finished Miss
Parrott.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>“AND SEE MY SLATE”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WAS Towsle your very own dog?”
asked Polly breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Sister’s and mine,” said Miss Parrott.
“You see one day he belonged to me, and the
next to her. And one night he slept on the
foot of her bed, and the next on mine. And
he never made a mistake—when he saw us
get into our nightgowns.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Polly, clasping her
hands. David crowded up closely, almost forgetting
the precious book in his hands. To
own a dog, and to have him sleep on your bed
at night!</p>

<p>“Would you like to see a picture of
Towsle?” asked Miss Parrott, with a keen
look into each face.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>would</i> you show it to us?” cried Polly
eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>Davie drew a long breath. It wasn’t necessary
for him to ask, as long as Polly did.</p>

<p>“You hold the doll,” Miss Parrott laid Priscilla
in Polly’s arm, “and stay there, children.”</p>

<p>So Polly and David waited by the big sofa
and watched Miss Parrott go over to a cabinet
on the wall. And pretty soon back she came
with an old-fashioned daguerreotype in her
hand.</p>

<p>“You see, Uncle John wanted to have our
pictures taken, and we begged to have Towsle
between us. So there we are!”</p>

<p>Miss Parrott pushed up the little spring and
there were two small girls in checked high-necked
dresses, with ruffles around the necks,
and hair brushed back and held by round
combs. A small fuzzy-wuzzy dog with eyes
like black shoe buttons sat primly up between
the two.</p>

<p>Polly and David gazed perfectly absorbed at
the picture. At last Miss Parrott asked,
“Now which of these two little girls do you
think is my picture?”</p>

<p>“Were you ever a little girl?” It was impossible
for David to keep from asking the
question now, although the instant it was out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
he knew that a terrible blunder had been made.</p>

<p>“Oh, Davie!” exclaimed Polly, greatly
mortified.</p>

<p>“It’s no wonder that you ask, Davie,” Miss
Parrott smiled at him, so he raised his head,
“so many years have passed. Well, which of
those two little girls do you think I was?”</p>

<p>David considered slowly—then put his
finger on one. There was something in the
kind eyes that made him think of Miss Parrott
when she smiled at him.</p>

<p>“Which do you think, Polly?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said, “but I think this
one,” and she chose the other little girl.</p>

<p>“Davie is right,” said Miss Parrott, with
another smile for him. And Polly beamed at
him, for it really was nicer that he had guessed
the right one.</p>

<p>“Did Towsle like to have his picture
taken?” asked Polly.</p>

<p>“No,” said Miss Parrott, with a little laugh,
“not at first. He barked dreadfully at the
man who was trying to take the picture, and he
said at last that he couldn’t let the dog be in it.
And Uncle John said then nobody would have
a picture taken at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“O dear!—what did you do?” cried Polly.</p>

<p>“And wasn’t there any picture?” cried
David, dreadfully worried.</p>

<p>“Why, yes—see—here it is.” Miss Parrott
tapped it with a long hand, on which shone
several ancestral rings.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot,” said Davie, looking down at
the daguerreotype in her lap.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Parrott, what <i>did</i> you do?”
begged Polly anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, the man went out and told his little
girl to come in. They had just been making
some molasses candy, and she brought a piece.
And he told her to hold it up, so that the dog
could see it. And then he got back of his little
black thing over the picture machine, and he
stuck up his head, and said, ‘All right—sit
still, children,’ and then something clicked, and
we were all taken.”</p>

<p>“Towsle was good to sit still, wasn’t he,
Miss Parrott,” cried Polly, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. You see he knew it was
candy that the little girl held. That was the
way Sister and I always made him keep still
before we gave him any. So he never took his
eyes off from it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“And did he get the candy—did he?” cried
David in great excitement.</p>

<p>“To be sure he did,” laughed Miss Parrott,
“and it took him ever so long to eat it, for he
got his teeth all stuck together. And Uncle
John paid the man, and then he said, ‘Hasn’t
that dog finished his candy yet?’ for there was
Towsle whirling around, putting up first one
paw and then another to his face to try to get
his jaws apart. You see the candy was too
soft.” Miss Parrott burst into a hearty laugh
in which Polly and David joined.</p>

<p>“And Towsle wouldn’t take any molasses
candy when Sister and I offered it to him after
that,” said Miss Parrott, wiping her eyes.
“Dear me, children, I don’t know when I have
laughed so. Well, now I must put the
daguerreotype up.”</p>

<p>When she came back to the big sofa,
she looked at David, the book tightly clasped
in his hands.</p>

<p>“Now I must tell you about this. So you
chose a book, Davie?” as he laid it in her
hands.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Davie, “I did.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Miss Parrott turned the leaves of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
an old First Reader. “Now this makes me
very sad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t tell about it, if it makes you feel
bad,” cried Polly in distress. “You don’t
want her to, Davie, do you?”</p>

<p>Davie swallowed hard, trying to say, “No,
don’t tell about it.”</p>

<p>But before he could get the words out, Miss
Parrott said quickly, “I really should like to
tell about it, children. Well, you see, I wasn’t
quick about learning to read, as Sister was, and
our governess—”</p>

<p>“What’s a gover—what you said?” David
broke in. He must know if he really were
going to understand about the book.</p>

<p>“Oh, Davie!” cried Polly reprovingly,
“you mustn’t interrupt.”</p>

<p>“A governess was the lady who taught Sister
and me our lessons. You see we didn’t go
to school, but studied at home.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Polly and David together.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Barton, that was her name, had
a good deal of trouble with me, I suppose.
And one thing that I was the slowest to learn,
was spelling. I was quite dull at it. And one
day—this is the part that makes me sad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
children, I was very naughty. I was determined
I would spell my own way, and I began
at the word ‘From.’” She turned the next
page, and there in the midst of a little story was
the word “From” beginning a new sentence,
and around it were queer little crumpled-up
places in the paper.</p>

<p>“Those are the tears I shed afterward,” said
Miss Parrott, pointing to them.</p>

<p>“O dear!” cried both children, quite overcome
to see these tears that were cried out of
Miss Parrott’s eyes so long ago.</p>

<p>“You see, Miss Barton would have Sister
and me stand up before her while she picked
out words for us to spell, and then she would
have us read the story to which they belonged,
and she gave me that word,” Miss Parrott’s
finger pointed to “From” in the midst of the
crumply spots, “and I spelled it ‘Frum,’ and I
wouldn’t spell it any other way, although she
told me how. I kept saying, ‘<span class="gesperrt"><i>Frum—Frum</i></span>’
over and over, and Sister tried to
make me obey Miss Barton, but I shook my
head, and kept saying, ‘<span class="gesperrt"><i>Frum</i></span>’ and at last
our governess had to call Mother.”</p>

<p>The room was very still now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Well, when our Mother came into the little
room, I remember I longed to run into her arms
and say I was sorry, but something inside of
me held me back, and Mother led me away, and
Sister burst out crying.”</p>

<p>“Well, children,” said Miss Parrott, after a
pause, “I shall never forget how I suffered as
I sat on the little stool in a room by myself,
which was our punishment when we were
naughty, and thought it all over. And I can
never see the word ‘From’ that it doesn’t come
back to me. Well now, Davie, so you chose a
book?” she added brightly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” said David, still keeping his
eyes on “From.”</p>

<p>“You like books pretty well, do you?” asked
Miss Parrott, with a keen glance.</p>

<p>“Davie just loves books,” declared Polly impulsively,
as Davie raised sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“And there was another thing that Sister
and I had to help us with our spelling. We
each had a slate.”</p>

<p>“A <i>slate</i>!” screamed Davie. “Oh, did you
really have a slate?”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Miss Parrott.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“All to yourself?” cried Davie, quite gone
with excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed—we each had one. Do you
want to see them?”</p>

<p>Davie’s eyes said “Yes” without the word.
But he said it aloud nevertheless.</p>

<p>Miss Parrott went over to the same cabinet
and put up the doll and the daguerreotype,
bringing back two small slates, with a pencil
and a little sponge hanging to each.</p>

<p>“Sister’s had a green edge,” she said, holding
first one slate up to notice, and then the
other, “and this one is mine—with a red
border.”</p>

<p>“May I hold it?” begged David, longingly
reaching up his hands.</p>

<p>“Indeed you may,” said Miss Parrott, giving
it to him. “And, Davie, you may keep
that slate. I can’t give away Sister’s—I shall
keep that always—but that one is mine. I
hope you like red best?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I do,” said Davie, clasping the slate
hungrily. “Is it mine—all mine?”</p>

<p>“It’s yours to keep always,” said Miss Parrott
decidedly, “and I am so glad that you like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
it. Well now, Polly, I’m going to give you a
little plant to carry home. I hope you like
flowers.”</p>

<p>For answer Polly clasped her hands. It was
all she could do to keep from hopping up and
down in delight. Seeing this, Miss Parrott
took her hand. “We will go down and choose
it,” she said.</p>

<p>David, hanging to his red-bordered slate, followed
them down-stairs and out through the
little green lattice door.</p>

<p>When they reached the little green plot with
the stone seats, Miss Parrott sat down, for all
the unusual happenings of this day made a little
rest seem very sweet. But she looked at
Polly’s and David’s dancing feet, and said,
“You run about, children, and I will come presently,
and pick out a plant for Polly.”</p>

<p>No need for a second invitation. Like little
wild things, they were off up to the big green
trees, David hanging to his red-bordered slate
for dear life.</p>

<p>“Put it down, Davie, do,” begged Polly,
“under that tree. We can’t play tag with any
fun if you hold the slate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“No—no,” cried Davie in alarm, and
grasping it tighter.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, never mind,” said Polly.
“Now, come on,” with a pat on his shoulder,
“you’re it.”</p>

<p>“She’s all tired out,” declared the housemaid,
peering out of the green lattice door,
“look at her a-settin’ there. I sh’d think she
would be with them childern round her all
day.”</p>

<p>“Bad luck to ’em,” exclaimed the cross cook,
coming up to look over the housemaid’s
shoulder. “Well, I never—jest look at ’em
a-racin’ an’ a-chasin’ all over th’ place! Did
anybody ever see sech goin’s-on in this garden
before?”</p>

<p>The butler didn’t dare, since his reproof in
the dining-room, to join this conversation, but
he shrugged up his shoulders, as he kept on at
his task of polishing up the family plate.</p>

<p>And Miss Parrott being nicely rested, more
by hearing the happy voices and watching the
flying feet, than by sitting still on the little
stone seat, got up presently. “Come, children,”
she called, “we must choose Polly’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
plant,” and in almost no time at all, they both
stood before her.</p>

<p>Around and around the old-fashioned garden
bright with hollyhocks and all sorts of blossoms
and shrubs, they went, Miss Parrott with
her finger on her chin, a way she had when she
was thinking, and Polly holding her breath
whenever a stop was made before a little plant.</p>

<p>At last Miss Parrott paused before a row of
little yellow primroses, lifting their bright faces
as if to say, “Take me—oh do, take me!”</p>

<p>“I really believe, Polly,” said Miss Parrott,
looking down at them, “that you will like one
of these. I am sure they were great favorites
of mine when I was a little girl.”</p>

<p>For answer Polly threw herself down on her
knees, and laid her flushed cheek against a
small cluster of yellow blooms.</p>

<p>“You may pick out the one you like best,”
said Miss Parrott.</p>

<p>“Oh, this one—if you please,” cried Polly,
lifting a little pot. “I choose this one—and
thank you, dear Miss Parrott.”</p>

</figure>

<p>“I really believe you have made a good selection,
Polly,” said Miss Parrott, the color rising
to her sallow cheek. It was so long since any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
one had called her “dear.” “Well now, I am
sorry to say it is getting time for me to send
you home, for I have much enjoyed the day,
but your mother will never allow you to come
again if I keep you too long,” and she led the
way into the house, where Polly got her hat and
Davie his cap.</p>

<p>Miss Parrott led the way down the broad
hall, with its rugs on the polished floor and the
portraits of her ancestors lining the walls.
She looked back as she neared the big oaken
door to see Polly standing spellbound before
the drawing-room, and Davie by her side.</p>

<p>“Would you like to go in, dear?” Miss Parrott
came back and pointed within the long
apartment.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I may,” said Polly, in an awe-struck
little voice.</p>

<p>“Certainly, dear, and Davie, too.” Then
she followed, curious to see what would first
claim attention.</p>

<p>Polly went straight to the big grand piano
standing half across two long French windows,
and stood quite still. David came softly after.</p>

<p>“If you can play, Polly,” said Miss Parrott,
not thinking of anything else to break the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
silence, “I am quite willing that you should,
dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t play,” said Polly, coming out of
her absorption with a little laugh at the very
idea.</p>

<p>“She plays on the table,” said Davie, looking
up at Miss Parrott.</p>

<p>“Plays on the table?” repeated Miss Parrott
in a puzzled way. “I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Just like this,” Davie having by this time
quite forgotten to be embarrassed, went over
to the big mahogany center-table, and laying
down his beloved slate, softly ran his fingers
up and down the shining surface.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean instead of a piano she uses a
table.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Davie, picking up his slate, and
running back to stand by Polly.</p>

<p>Miss Parrott was quite still for a moment regarding
Polly. Then she said, “Would you
like to have me play to you, Polly?”</p>

<p>Polly drew a long breath, and tore her gaze
away from the big piano.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you would!” she cried with shining
eyes.</p>

<p>So Miss Parrott sat down on the music-stool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
and drew her long figure up just as the music
master had instructed her years ago, and began
to finger the keys, Polly, with her little plant in
her hand, standing in rapt attention, on one
side, and David, with his slate, on the other.</p>

<p>At first the tunes didn’t go very well, Miss
Parrott observing, “I don’t know when I have
tried this before,” and breaking into some other
selection. But by degrees, the slender fingers
began to run up and down quite at their ease
among the black and white keys, and the long
somber drawing-room seemed to glow with the
trills and quavers.</p>

<p>“My soul an’ body!” exclaimed the cross
cook to the housemaid, “ef she ain’t playin’ th’
pianner. I’m scared to death, Mary Jane.”</p>

<p>Mary Jane’s florid face turned two shades
paler. “I expect she’s going to die,” she
whimpered.</p>

<p>And over in the big drawing-room, their mistress
was just beginning to blame herself for
keeping them so long. She arose hastily from
the music-stool. “And now it is good-by.”
She laid a gentle hand on each head. “Run
out and get into the carriage,” for Simmons
had been waiting all this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>She opened the big oaken door, and waited
to see them off—then turned back with a curious
light on her sallow face.</p>

<p>And Polly and Davie being set down at the
gate of the little brown house, raced up to the
big green door, and burst in. “I’ve a plant—a
dear, little plant,” announced Polly, raising it
high.</p>

<p>“And see my slate,” Davie tried to reach
higher than Polly, “and it’s all my very own,—it
is, Mamsie.”</p>

<small>AT GRANDMA BASCOM’S</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“DAVIE must go over and sit with Grandma
Bascom,” said Mrs. Pepper slowly.
She looked worried as she glanced up from her
sewing by the window; then she smiled brightly
over to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamsie,” began Polly in dismay.</p>

<p>Davie laid down his slate carefully on the
table, and ran over to Mother Pepper’s chair.</p>

<p>“You see, Davie,” said Mrs. Pepper, snipping
off a little thread hanging from the sleeve
to the coat she was trying to finish, “no one
else can be spared, and Grandma mustn’t be
left alone, now that she is sick.”</p>

<p>Polly took two or three quick little stitches
in the other sleeve, then she threw down the
needle. “But Davie was going to help Mr.
Atkins, you know, Mamsie,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Mr. Atkins told Davie he was only to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
when not wanted for anything else, you
know,” said Mrs. Pepper, not pausing in her
work.</p>

<p>“But, Mamsie,” began Polly again, at sight
of Davie’s face.</p>

<p>“No, no, Polly,” said Mother Pepper firmly.
“Davie must go to Grandma Bascom. And
hurry now, child, for work as we may, it will
be much as ever we finish the coat in time.”
She said no more to Davie, who stood silently
by her chair, and the kitchen became very
quiet except for the ticking of the old clock on
the shelf.</p>

<p>“I’ll—I’ll go—Mamsie,” said Davie, swallowing
hard.</p>

<p>“That’s Mother’s boy,” said Mrs. Pepper,
beaming at him.</p>

<p>Davie wanted dreadfully to take his precious
red-bordered slate along so that he could practise
his writing, but since no one said anything
about it, he didn’t like to ask. So he took
it off from the table, and going over to the
shelf, he stood up on his tiptoes and deposited
it behind the old clock. Then he went out
and down the lane to Grandma Bascom’s.</p>

<p>Polly looked up a few minutes after and saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
that the table was bare. “Well, I’m glad,
anyway,” she said, as she stopped to bite off a
thread, “that Davie took his slate. Now he
can practise on his writing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that, Polly,” said Mother Pepper
reprovingly; “never bite your thread. It’s
bad for the teeth, child.”</p>

<p>“My teeth are awfully strong, Mamsie,”
laughed Polly, snapping her two rows of little
white ones together.</p>

<p>“You never can tell how strong teeth are
if they are used to bite threads,” said her
mother; “so be sure you never do it, Polly.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” promised Polly, stitching merrily
away again; “only it’s so hard to remember.
I bite off threads before I think, Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“That’s about the poorest excuse a body can
give,—‘don’t think,’” remarked Mrs. Pepper.
“Well, child, you sew better every day.”</p>

<p>“Do I, Mamsie?” cried Polly, a warm little
thrill running up and down her whole body,
and the color crept into her cheek; “do I,
really?”</p>

<p>“You do indeed,” declared Mrs. Pepper,
“and such a help as you are to me!”</p>

<p>“Some day,” said Polly, sitting very straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
and sewing away for dear life, “I’m going to
do every single bit of all the coats, Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“And what should I do then?” asked Mrs.
Pepper with a laugh.</p>

<p>“You would sit right there in your chair,”
said Polly, “but you shouldn’t take a single
stitch—not even the smallest, teentiest stitch.”</p>

<p>“O dear me!” exclaimed Mother Pepper,
as her needle flew in and out.</p>

<p>“Because I’m going to do ’em all, every bit
of every coat,” declared Polly positively, and
bobbing her brown head.</p>

<p>“Work isn’t the worst thing that can happen
to a body,” observed Mrs. Pepper. “But
to sit in a chair with nothing to do—oh,
Polly!”</p>

<p>Her look of dismay as she said, “Oh,
Polly!” was so funny that Polly burst out
laughing, and Mamsie laughed, too, till the old
kitchen became cheery at once, and the sun
breaking out suddenly two bright little spots
danced out on the floor to have fun by themselves.</p>

<p>Davie hurried down the lane to Grandma’s
and turned into the small patch before the
kitchen door. The hens had found an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
beef-bone and were making an awful noise
fighting bill and claw for its possession.</p>

<p>Davie hurried on over the sill into the bedroom.
There was Grandma in bed, the gay
patched bedquilt drawn up nearly to the big
frill of her cap, showing eyes that were not in
the least expressive of comfort. When she
saw Davie, she pushed off the coverlet. “O
my Land!” she said. “Grandma’s glad to see
you!”</p>

<p>By the side of the bed, sitting stiffly on the
edge of a cane-bottom chair, sat the parson’s
elder son.</p>

<p>“My mother told me to ask how she is,”
he said.</p>

<p>Grandma beckoned to Davie, and patting the
coverlet, he climbed up. “He’s ben a-settin’
there an’ a-settin’ there by the bed,” she
said.</p>

<p>“My mother told me to ask how she is,”
came from Peletiah in his chair, “and she
won’t tell me. My mother told me—” he
began again.</p>

<p>“He won’t go home,” said Grandma, drawing
Davie’s ear close to her mouth. “O dear
me! an’ he’s th’ parson’s son.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“My mother told me—” began Peletiah
once more.</p>

<p>Just then there was an awful cackle and
clatter out in the kitchen. The beef-bone fight
concluded, every scrap of a mouthful being
gobbled up, the hens had come tumbling in
over the sill all together to see what could be
found, now that Grandma was sick in bed and
couldn’t drive them out.</p>

<p>Davie told Grandma this. He had to say it
over several times, his mouth under her cap-frill.</p>

<p>“My sakes!” she exclaimed, “you take th’
broom an’ shoo ’em out o’ the kitchen, Davie,
an’ shet th’ door tight after ’em.”</p>

<p>So Davie slipped down from the bed, glad
enough to have something to do.</p>

<p>“My mother told me—” began Peletiah.</p>

<p>“An’ you go with him an’ help drive out
them pesky hens,” cried Grandma, rolling over
in bed to look at him. “An’ I’m well enough,
so you needn’t come again, you tell your Ma.”</p>

<p>Peletiah never waited to hear more than
the last sentence that told him what he had
come to find out. He got off from his chair in
great satisfaction and went out into the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
kitchen where Davie was waving the broom
over the wild fluttering tangle of hens, all
squawking together, as he tried to drive them
out of doors.</p>

<p>“O dear! one’s running into the bedroom.
Keep her out, Peletiah—hurry!” cried Davie
in great distress.</p>

<p>But Peletiah, never having hurried in his
life, couldn’t understand why he should do so
now. So the hen had plenty of time to run
around him and fluffed and squawked her way
into the bedroom, where she ducked under
Grandma’s big four-poster.</p>

<p>“She’s gone under Grandma’s bed,” announced
Peletiah, coming up to where Davie,
leaning under the big table, had seized one hen
by the leg, and was wildly trying to catch
another. At last he had her,—but she turned
and gave him a vicious little peck on his hand
as he backed out holding on for dear life to
them both.</p>

<p>“There’s a hen gone under Grandma’s bed,”
said Peletiah again.</p>

<p>“O dear—dear!” exclaimed Davie, trying
to hold fast to the two struggling biddies.</p>

<p>But they flapped so violently that one got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
away, and thinking that where another Mrs.
Biddy went, it was easy to follow, this one
ran around Peletiah’s slow legs, and there they
were, two of them, under Grandma’s big four-poster.</p>

<p>Davie shut the door on his vanquished
fowl, and turned his hot tired face to the parson’s
son.</p>

<p>“We must get them out.”</p>

<p>“We can’t,” said Peletiah. He might be
slow, but he knew when it was impossible to
accomplish a thing. “You can’t get hens out
from under a bed,” he said positively.</p>

<p>“We must,” said Davie in great distress—but
just as decidedly.</p>

<p>“And she can’t hear ’em,” said Peletiah.</p>

<p>“But they can’t stay there,” persisted David.
“You stand one side of the bed, and I’ll stand
the other with the broom, and drive ’em out.”
And he ran and laid hold of the broom again.</p>

<p>“I want the broom,” said Peletiah, reaching
a hand for it.</p>

<p>“Grandma told me to drive out the hens.”</p>

<p>“Well, she didn’t say with the broom.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” cried Davie eagerly, “she said,
‘Take the broom and shoo ’em out.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“She said out of the kitchen—she didn’t
say bedroom,” declared Peletiah, who was nothing
if not exact.</p>

<p>“So she did,” said Davie, giving up the
broom with a sigh. “Well, you drive ’em
away from your side, but I must tell Grandma
first.”</p>

<p>So he climbed up on the bed again and put
his mouth close to the big cap-frill, and told
what was going to be done.</p>

<p>“Land alive! what’s come to your thumb,”
cried Grandma in great consternation.</p>

<p>David looked down at his small thumb.
The blood had run down and stiffened into a
small patch of red where Mrs. Biddy had
nipped it. “It doesn’t hurt,” he said, trying to
stick his thumb away from the eyes under the
cap-frill.</p>

<p>“Now to think that you sh’d ’a’ come over
to take care of me, an’ got hurt,” moaned
Grandma. “O me—O my! what will your
Ma say! Well, you must have some opedildoc
on, right away. Run out an’ go to the cupboard,
an’ you’ll find a bottle on th’ upper shelf.
I put it there to be handy, ef any one gets hurt.
My son John mos’ had his leg took off one day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
when he was mowin’ in th’ south medder an’
they come a-runnin’ for me.”</p>

<p>Grandma didn’t think to tell that the same
bottle couldn’t be found on that occasion, but
she had always been under the impression that
it had saved son John’s life.</p>

<p>“Can’t we drive out the hens first?” asked
Davie, slipping off from the bed.</p>

<p>“Mercy no—th’ hens can wait—they’re
comf’table under th’ bed. You run an’ get
that bottle.”</p>

<p>So Davie ran out into the kitchen while
Peletiah, leaning on the broom, waited by the
side of the bed.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to git up on a chair,” called
Grandma from the bed, “it’s on th’ upper
shelf.”</p>

<p>So David pulled up a chair and climbed up
on it. But even on his tiptoes he couldn’t
reach, although he tried and tried until his
face got very red.</p>

<p>“I can reach with a box—there’s one,” he
said. And jumping down he ran over to the
corner, and emptied out a few apples and deposited
the box on the chair.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s back of th’ teapot,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Grandma. “I remember now that teapot got
cracked, and I put it up there. Look behind
it, Davie.”</p>

<p>So Davie looked behind it, holding on to the
edge of the shelf with one hand, and feeling
around with the other. But no bottle was in
sight. There were some papers of herbs, and,
as they got stirred about, the little fine particles
coming out of various holes made him sneeze.</p>

<p>“You’re ketchin’ cold,” said Grandma, who
was getting dreadfully nervous. “Mercy
me! what will your ma say ef you got sick
over here, an’ she’s had sech trouble with th’
measles. O dear—deary me!”</p>

<p>David by this time was in great distress at
not being able to find what he was sent for.
And to think of Grandma sick and worried—that
was the worst of it—so he worked on.</p>

<p>“I remember now—it’s come to me—’twa’n’t
on that upper shelf at all,” said
Grandma. “I took it down one day, ’cause
thinks I ’twon’t be so easy for me with my
rheumatics to stretch clear up there, an’ I put
it on the one underneath.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad it’s on the one underneath,” said
Davie, joyfully. So he got down from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
heights, and put the box in the corner and the
apples back in it again. Then he hopped up
on the chair and peered all along the bottles
and various things cluttered up on the shelf.</p>

<p>“Is it a very big bottle?” he asked, his blue
eyes roving anxiously over the array.</p>

<p>“O my land, no,” said Grandma; “’tain’t
big, an’ it ain’t little. It’s jest a bottle.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Davie, trying to think what he
ought to leave out in the search.</p>

<p>“You better bring me one or two that you
think is it,” said Grandma at last.</p>

<p>So Davie picking off from the shelf some
“jest bottles” hurried with them to Grandma’s
bed.</p>

<p>“My sakes!” she said, not looking at them
and lifting up her hands, “what a sight you
be, Davie Pepper!”</p>

<p>“You’re all dirt,” said Peletiah pleasantly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t s’pose I had any cobwebs in that
cupboard,” said Grandma in a mortified voice.
“An’ you’re all a-runnin’ with sweat. Well,
you’ve got to wipe your face—there’s a towel
there on th’ bureau.”</p>

<p>“Here are the bottles,” said Davie. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
eyes peered at her under his soft light hair
where the herbs had drifted down.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, so they be,” said Grandma, taking
them. “Well, ’tain’t th’ opedildoc—none
of ’em ain’t. You wash your face, Davie, first,
an’ then you can look again. There won’t be
no cobwebs on the lower shelf.”</p>

<p>So Davie took the towel and ran out to the
sink, and washed up. He shook his hair
pretty well; but some of the little green things
stayed in the soft waves. Then he took the
bottles away from the bed where Grandma
laid them, and brought away some more “jest
bottles.”</p>

<p>But no opodeldoc appeared, and at last
Grandma lay back on her pillows dreadfully
disappointed.</p>

<p>“Can’t I look some other place?” begged
Davie, climbing up on the bed to lay his mouth
against her ear.</p>

<p>“No mortal man would know where to tell
you,” moaned Grandma.</p>

<p>“O dear!” exclaimed Davie, laying his
hot little cheek against her wrinkled one.
“There’s a bottle on that little table.” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
pointed over toward the big old bureau.
“May I get it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it ain’t a mite o’ use,” said the
old lady, hopelessly.</p>

<p>So Davie slid off from the bed once more,
and went over to the small table by the side
of the bureau and brought the bottle and put
it in Grandma’s hand.</p>

<p>“Land o’ Goshen, now it’s come to me!
How glad I am I remember. I took that down
from th’ shelf th’ other day when I cut my
finger peelin’ potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Is that the—what you said?” gasped
Davie.</p>

<p>“Yes,—it’s th’ opedildoc.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Davie, and his blue eyes shone,
and he clasped his hands in bliss. He didn’t
have to go home and tell Mamsie he couldn’t
find Grandma’s things when she was sick and
he had come to help.</p>

<p>“Now you go to the lowest drawer in th’
bureau,” said Grandma, “and get a roll of old
white cotton, an’ I’ll tie up your thumb.”</p>

<p>David looked down at his thumb. He had
forgotten all about it in the general turmoil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“It doesn’t hurt any,” he said, “and I
washed the blood off.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” said Grandma, who wasn’t
going to lose what she dearly loved to do:
bind up any wounds that presented themselves,
“but a hurt is a hurt, and it’s got to be took
care of. An’ there’s some blood a-comin’
yet.”</p>

<p>A tiny drop or two making its appearance
to her satisfaction, she made David sit up on
the bed again. And at last the little thumb
was all bound up, and the cloth tied up with a
bit of string she found in the little table-drawer
by her bed.</p>

<p>“An’ now you must go right straight home—an’
you tell your ma she don’t need to
tetch that bandage till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t driven out the hens,” said
Peletiah, still standing by his broom.</p>

<p>“Hey?” said Grandma. “What does he
say, Davie?”</p>

<p>“He says we haven’t driven out the hens.
Oh, I forgot them, Grandma,” said Davie in a
sorry little voice. It was impossible to be
more mortified than he was at this moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“Well, you can do it now,” said Grandma
composedly; “it’s gittin’ late, and hens knows
better’n most folks when it’s along about time
to go to bed. They’ll go easy—like enough.”</p>

<p>David lifted up the calico valance running
around the bed, and Peletiah got down on his
knees and lifted up the part hanging down
his side. There bunched up together were the
two fat biddies. They turned sleepy eyes on
the two boys. And when Peletiah inserted
the broom under the bed, they got up, shook
their feathers, and marched off to the kitchen,
and so out of doors, much preferring to roost
respectably on a tree than under a feather bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>THE FISHING PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">“I VERY much wish I could go,” said
David to himself, and he sighed clear
down in his little heart. Then he crept out
from behind the wood-pile, his favorite place
when he had anything to think out, and
started to run as fast as he could down the
lane into the high road.</p>

<p>“Because if I don’t hurry, Joel will ask
Mamsie to let me go, too, and I promised Mr.
Atkins I’d help him keep store to-day.</p>

<p>“And besides,” as he panted on, “I should
lose the ten cents he’d give me for Mamsie.”</p>

<p>So he was all hot and tired out when he
pushed open the door to the store. Mr. Atkins
was behind the counter.</p>

<p>“You needn’t to ’a’ hurried so,” he said;
“you’re all het up, Davie. Now set down an’
rest.”</p>

<p>David, without much breath to spare, said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
nothing, as he climbed up on the sugar-barrel,
his usual place when there was a chance to
sit down, and folded his hands to wait for
orders.</p>

<p>But before these came, the door was swung
violently open, and in rushed Joel.</p>

<p>“What made you run off?” he demanded.
“Mamsie says you can go,” and he plunged
across the store to David on his barrel.</p>

<p>“Hulloa!” cried Mr. Atkins, “hain’t you
no time to say good morning? Your ma
wouldn’t like you to lose your manners.”</p>

<p>Joel, very much ashamed, deserted David
and ran over to the counter. “I’m sorry,” he
began, his face very red, and his black stubby
head bobbing. “I didn’t mean to forget.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Mr. Atkins. “Well now,
what’s the rumpus, pray tell, Joel?”</p>

<p>“He can go,” said Joel, pounding one fist
on the counter; “Mamsie says he can.”</p>

<p>“Who, Davie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he can go. Mamsie says so, if you
don’t want him.” Then Joel, fearing that one
fist was not enough to emphasize his statement,
now began with the other till the pieces of
paper on the counter were all in a flutter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“Hold on there, Joe,” said Mr. Atkins,
“or, first you know, you’ll have us all a-blowing
out the door.”</p>

<p>Joel stopped pounding and looked anxiously
over at the store door, while Mr. Atkins
laughed and leaned over the counter.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about—where do you want
David to go?” he asked.</p>

<p>David, who up to this time had sat quite
still, now hopped from his barrel and ran over
to Joel. “Oh, I can’t go,” he cried. “I’m
going to stay here and help Mr. Atkins.”</p>

<p>Joel whirled around and seized Davie’s
calico blouse. “You can,” he howled, “you
can, Davie—”</p>

<p>“Where do you want David to go?” demanded
the storekeeper, between Joel’s howls
and David’s remonstrances.</p>

<p>“Fishing,” said Joel. Then he turned a
face of anguish. “Do make him,” he cried,
still hanging to David’s blouse.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to go, Davie?” asked Mr.
Atkins with a keen glance at him.</p>

<p>David stopped crying. “Oh, I can’t go,”
and hung his head. He wanted dreadfully to
say, “No, sir,” but Mamsie had always told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
them all to speak the truth. So he said,
“Yes,” in a very low voice.</p>

<p>“Then I guess you better go,” said the
storekeeper.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” cried Davie, springing away
from Joel. “I can’t go. Don’t make me,
Mr. Atkins.”</p>

<p>“You mean because you promised to help
me to-day, David?” said Mr. Atkins.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—and do make Joel stop.”
David was now in such a panic that Mr. Atkins
came out from behind the counter. “See here,
Joe,” and he seized his arm, “you get up on
Davie’s barrel an’ set still if you can.” And
before Joel quite knew how, there he was, and
the storekeeper and Davie were settling matters
by themselves.</p>

<p>“You see,” Mr. Atkins was saying, “it’s
quite lucky that I want to set about some
things to-day in the store where you can’t help
me, Davie.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I, Mr. Atkins?” cried David.</p>

<p>“No; fact is, I’d ruther you’d come to-morrow,
’nstead o’ to-day,” said Mr. Atkins
decidedly. “You can go fishing as well as
not. Hop down, Joe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>No need to tell Joel. He was off the sugar-barrel
and down by David’s side in a twinkling.</p>

<p>“Got any fish-pole, Davie?” asked the storekeeper.
He was back by the counter now,
and rummaging on his shelves.</p>

<p>Before David could answer, Joel piped,
“Yes—we made ’em.”</p>

<p>“An’ fish-hooks?” Mr. Atkins went on,
bending over to get a small box on the lower
shelf.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Joel. “Mrs. Blodgett
gave us some big pins. Come on, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Well now, David,” said the storekeeper,
turning around, a fish-pole in one hand and
two or three fish-hooks in the other. “Here’s
somethin’ for you. You’ve ben a good boy
an’ helped me fust-rate.”</p>

<p>Joel rushed over to the counter, his black
eyes sparkling. David came up slowly.</p>

<p>“Hold your hands, Davie,” said Mr. Atkins.
“Now, says I, I guess you can ketch some
fish. Hurry up, my boy,” as David hung
back.</p>

<p>“Can’t—can’t Joel have ’em?” asked
Davie.</p>

<p>“No—no, these are for you. You’ve ben<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
helpin’ me real good in th’ store.” Mr. Atkins
dangled the fish-pole before the boys. Joel
held his breath and crowded closely up.</p>

<p>“Joel could catch more fish with ’em,” said
Davie, the color dropping out from his little
face.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe,” said the storekeeper with a
keen glance at Joel, who twisted his brown
hands tightly together, trying not to say how
very much he wanted that fish-pole and those
splendid hooks. “There, hold out your hands,
Davie.”</p>

<p>David put forth a pair of hands that shook
so that the fish-hooks tumbled out of them, and
down to the floor.</p>

<p>“I’ll pick ’em up,” cried Joel, scrambling
after them. He held them a minute, trying
the sharp points on his small thumb, and turning
them over and over admiringly.</p>

<p>“Now it just comes to me, I do verily
b’lieve I’ve got another fish-pole like David’s,”
said Mr. Atkins reflectively, and turning back
to his shelves.</p>

<p>“Is it for me? Oh, is it, Mr. Atkins?”
screamed Joel, and he tumbled the fish-hooks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
into David’s hand and scrambled up on the
counter.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t wonder,” said the storekeeper
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh—oh!” Joel hopped up and down on
the counter, his black eyes shining in anticipation.
“Dave, he’s going to give me one,
too—he is—he is!” he screamed.</p>

<p>David, both hands full of his treasures, gave
a long blissful sigh, then hugged them to his
breast, and he laughed aloud in glee.</p>

<p>“Mercy sakes! Get down off th’ counter,
Joe,” said Mr. Atkins. “There,” as Joel slid
to the floor, putting a fish-pole, just the size
for a boy to swing, into the eager brown hand,
“an’ there’s th’ hooks. Be careful not to git
’em stuck into you.”</p>

<p>“They’re goin’ to be stuck into the fishes,”
cried Joel, seizing fish-pole and hooks. “I’m
going to catch lots and lots. Come on, Dave,”
beginning to march to the door in great excitement.
Then he remembered and ran back.
“I thank you,” he said, then dashed out.</p>

<p>“Now, run along, Davie,” said Mr. Atkins,
“or Joe will be down to th’ brook an’ catch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
every single fish before you have a chance to
get up with him.”</p>

<p>David stood quite still clasping his treasures,
as he tried to speak. His blue eyes shone, but
he couldn’t say a word.</p>

<p>“I know,” said the storekeeper kindly.
“Now you run along. I shall need you to-morrow,
for you are a great help to me,
David.”</p>

<p>David’s happy feet scarcely seemed to touch
the ground, as he hurried after Joel, almost
catching up with him turning into the gateway
of the little brown house.</p>

<p>It was some time before the boys could
settle down from the excitement of showing
their treasures, to the work of digging the
worms. Polly came out and helped them with
an old iron spoon. She couldn’t work fast
and her hand trembled, all her healthy young
body longing for the fun of the expedition.
But there was no hope that she could go—for
she must help Mamsie to finish the coats
brought home from the store the day before.
And there were the Henderson boys waiting,
Mrs. Pepper being willing, since the parson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
sons could go, to let Joel and David have this
pleasure.</p>

<p>At last they were off—all four of them—the
worms wriggling about in an old tin can
that Joel shook up and down at every step.</p>

<p>Polly hung over the old gate with Phronsie
by her side, to watch them off.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish I could ever have any fun,”
she said to herself. “The little path in the
woods is just lovely, and the dear brook! O
dear!—why can’t I ever go anywhere!”</p>

<p>“Polly,” asked Phronsie, giving a little
twitch to Polly’s blue checked apron, “what
is the matter?”</p>

<p>“I’m not crying,” said Polly, turning her
face away.</p>

<p>“But your mouth looks like crying,” said
Phronsie, peering around anxiously at her.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind, Pet,” said Polly. Then
she drew a long breath. “Let me alone,
Phronsie. I’m bad this morning.”</p>

<p>“You’re never bad,” said Phronsie decidedly.
“Do let me see your face, Polly,” she
begged.</p>

<p>Polly swallowed hard. “I’ll tell you, Phronsie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
what let’s do—we’ll race down the road
to the corner and then turn and race back.
Catch me now.”</p>

<p>Phronsie, all intent now on the race, forgot
about Polly’s face. When they came back and
ran into the little brown house, Polly’s cheeks
were as rosy as ever, and Phronsie was laughing
gleefully.</p>

<p>When the “lovely little path in the woods”
was reached, Joel dashed ahead and Ezekiel at
his heels.</p>

<p>“You’re so slow,” Joel said, looking back at
Peletiah. So David had to hold back his feet,
longing for a run, to keep pace with the parson’s
eldest son.</p>

<p>The consequence was, as they came up to the
deep pool in the silvery little brook, Joel was
fixing his best hook on the line hanging from
his new pole. Ezekiel, too lost in admiration
to do anything to get his own made ready, was
hanging over him.</p>

<p>Peletiah sat down and calmly looked around.
“My father says you mustn’t splash the water
when you fish,” he said, as Joel made frantic
flings with his fish-line on which a long worm
made curves in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“I can fish,” shouted Joel, standing on a big
stone in the middle of the pool. “See— Come
on, Dave!”</p>

<p>David, who never could bear to stick a
worm on the hook, put his hand into the tin
can, then drew it back again. “Perhaps a
fish will bite without it,” he said to himself.
Then he went farther down the pool and behind
some bushes, and cast in his line.</p>

<p>“Come here!” shouted Joel, from his big
stone, and splashing the silvery surface on all
sides. “Come, Dave!”</p>

<p>“My father says you mustn’t splash the
water when you fish,” said Peletiah, beginning
slowly to choose a worm from the tin
can.</p>

<p>Joel turned a cold shoulder to the parson’s
son and continued to beat the water to right
and to left. Ezekiel seeing there was more
fun to be gained than to stay with Peletiah,
who was having difficulty with his worm,
stepped gingerly across the stepping-stones,
holding his pole carefully aloft.</p>

<p>“I’m coming,” he announced.</p>

<p>“No, no,” cried Joel crossly; “this is Dave’s
place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“I’m coming,” announced Ezekiel pleasantly,
as he picked his way along.</p>

<p>“You aren’t going to get on,” declared Joel,
spreading his small legs apart defiantly.</p>

<p>“I’m the minister’s son,” said Ezekiel, “and
you must let me get on.”</p>

<p>“No, I sha’n’t,” said Joel. Yet he had an
awful feeling down deep in his heart that he
ought to; but he stood his ground sturdily.</p>

<p>“And that stone is mine as much as it is
yours,” said Ezekiel, drawing near and balancing
his pole with great care.</p>

<p>“No, it’s mine, I got it first.” Joel squared
his shoulders, and gave a swish to his line that
sent his worm away off among the shining
ripples.</p>

<p>Just then came a cry from David. “I’ve
got a fish—I’ve got a fish!” in a jubilant
little voice.</p>

<p>Joel deserted his big stone and flew past
Ezekiel on the stepping-stones, who immediately
in great satisfaction stepped on to
the coveted place.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you get him in, Dave,” cried Joel,
plunging along the bushes where Dave, with a
very red face, was struggling to land a heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
weight on his hook. “I’ll get him for you.”</p>

<p>Joel threw aside his fish-pole, the long worm
still continuing his exercise, and dashing up,
laid his little brown hands next to David’s, and
together they pulled so hard that over backward
they went, and the fish-hook with an old
tangled root hanging to it flew straight up in
the air.</p>

<p>“O dear!” exclaimed David in great mortification,
as they picked themselves up and began
to untangle the root, “there wasn’t any
fish at all.”</p>

<p>“P’raps you had one, and he ate off the
worm,” said Joel, seeing David’s face.</p>

<p>David turned off to the bushes, leaving Joel
to get the old piece of root off. “I don’t need
to tell him that I didn’t have a worm on,”
he said to himself, and his hands worked
nervously.</p>

<p>“I ’most know a fish stole your worm,” Joel
kept saying as his hands were busy; “bad old
fish!”</p>

<p>David’s cheeks got so hot that he came out
of the shelter of the bushes. Could he go
home to Mamsie without telling Joel all about
it? Without stopping to think, he plunged up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
to Joel’s side. “I didn’t stick a worm on.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t stick a worm on?” repeated Joel
in amazement, dropping fish-hook, tangle of
root, and all.</p>

<p>“No,” said David in a miserable little voice.
“I didn’t, Joel.” Then he sat down on the
grass, and hid his face.</p>

<p>“Hoh!” sniffed Joel, “you can’t fish—any
more than—than—a girl.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joel, I can,” burst out Davie, leaping
to his feet. “I can, Joel—and I will put on
a worm,” but he shivered.</p>

<p>“You needn’t,” said Joel, turning back to
the root-tangle; “I’ll put ’em all on for you,—I
like to.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got one!” screamed Ezekiel.</p>

<p>Sure enough! There was the minister’s son
having the greatest difficulty in his excitement
to keep his footing on the big stone, swinging
his line, at the end of which was a little
speckled trout shining in the sunshine.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>DANGER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JOEL threw down the fish-pole, root-tangle,
and all, and rushed wildly over to Ezekiel
on the big stone. “Let me see him—let
me!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I shall take it home for my father,” said
Ezekiel in proud possession, holding up the
little speckled beauty dangling from the hook,
as he hurried over the stepping-stones.</p>

<p>“And I shall catch one and take it home to
my mother,” announced Peletiah, where he sat
by the side of the brook. He hadn’t even
chosen his worm, but was taking one after
another from the tin can, and laying them
down on the grass.</p>

<p>“They’re all running away,” cried Joel,
flying up with his own fish-pole and David’s,
the root-tangle still hanging. “Oh, they’re
all running away, Peletiah Henderson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“They can’t run,” said Peletiah, still busy
trying to decide which worm would be most
likely to entice a nice fish, “because they
haven’t got legs.”</p>

<p>“And there aren’t but a teenty-weenty
few,” cried Joel aghast at the loss. “Oh,
you’re a bad boy, Peletiah Henderson,” he
added wrathfully, as he examined the contents
of the tin can.</p>

<p>“I’m not a bad boy—I’m the minister’s
son,” said Peletiah calmly. And selecting the
longest and the fattest of the remaining worms,
he proceeded to fasten it on his hook.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. You’re the baddest of the
bad boys, and you shan’t have any more of
these worms.” With that Joel huddled up the
tin can within his arms, and marched off to a
safe corner back of the bushes.</p>

<p>“See my fish,” cried Ezekiel, coming up to
swing his line so that all the others could have
a good view. “I caught the first one.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said Joel, busy over David’s
tangled hook; “I’ll catch the next one.” Then
he twitched off the piece of root, stuck on a
worm, David hurrying off to cover his eyes,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
jumped to his feet, and in a minute he was
over on the big stone.</p>

<p>But he didn’t get the fish. Instead it was
Davie’s worm that met the eyes of a fat old
father trout that came lazily down the little
purling brook. He had always warned his
children, had this fat old trout, to beware of
boys, and dancing bugs and worms. But he
was tired on this day, and hungry, having
eaten nothing since a breakfast of two flies.
And the first thing he knew a juicy morsel was
in his mouth. But alas! he couldn’t swallow
it—for something stuck fast and held him
pinned. And one of those same dreadful boys
was shouting, “I have got one, Joel!”</p>

<p>When the fat old trout was laid on the grass,
all the boys stood around it in speechless
admiration.</p>

<p>Finally Joel found his tongue. “Dave
caught that,” he announced proudly. “My
brother Dave caught that all by himself.”</p>

<p>“It was Joel’s worm,” said Davie.</p>

<p>“I caught the first one,” said Ezekiel. He
couldn’t take his eyes from the big fish. At
last he ran and tucked his little trout in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
basket, and shut the cover down very tightly.</p>

<p>“Dave’s is bigger,” boasted Joel, strutting
off. “Hoh! your fish is a squinching little one,
Ezekiel Henderson.”</p>

<p>“I shall catch one now,” announced Peletiah,
going pompously off over the stepping-stones,
and carrying his fish-pole with a careful hand.</p>

<p>Joel dashed wildly past him, reaching the big
stone first. “This is my place,” he declared;
“I found it.”</p>

<p>“I shall stand on that stone,” declared Peletiah
decidedly, and crowding up to get both feet
on it.</p>

<p>As there wasn’t room for more than one,
the two boys couldn’t raise their arms enough
to swing the fish lines, so they whirled around
and around, each trying to get the best place
for their feet. At last Peletiah made an unlucky
movement, his foot slipped and in he
splashed, fish-pole and all.</p>

<p>“I’ll pull you out,” cried Joel, in the greatest
dismay, bending over the pool. O dear, if the
parson’s son should drown!</p>

</figure>

<p>“I don’t want you to,” said Peletiah, getting
up and paddling to the stepping-stones. Then
he marched over them in great dignity, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
dripping water dreadfully. “I am going
home, and I shall tell my mother how you
crowded me off the big stone.”</p>

<p>Joel deserted the big stone by a single bound.</p>

<p>“Don’t—O dear!—Mamsie will feel—<i>don’t</i>,
Peletiah,” he begged, plunging frantically
after him.</p>

<p>David deserted his big fish, having sat down
on the grass by its side, happy in the thought
of taking it home to Mamsie, to run up and
mingle his entreaties with those of Joel.</p>

<p>“I shall stay and catch a bigger fish than
David’s,” announced Ezekiel, preparing to select
another worm.</p>

<p>“I am going home,” declared Peletiah, stalking
off. Instead of taking the wood-path, he
turned into a meadow where a number of cows
were grazing.</p>

<p>Joel, with no thought of the fish-pole he was
leaving behind but only that he must prevent
Peletiah from taking such a dreadful tale to
the parsonage, plunged after him. And Davie,
recklessly abandoning the big fish, followed
in the greatest distress.</p>

<p>Peletiah kept swinging his fish-pole and
stalked on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>Suddenly there was a great noise. It was
just like a roar of wind—then a queer sound,
and that was a bellow, and an old bull, that
didn’t like anybody, least of all a boy, to
come swinging things around in the field that
belonged to him and to the cows, gave a snort
and came charging down across the meadow.</p>

<p>Joel saw him first. “The bull—the bull!”
he screamed.</p>

<p>Peletiah, quite lost to everything but the
story he was carrying to the parsonage, kept
on his dignified way, swinging his fish-pole triumphantly.</p>

<p>Joel took a long breath. By turning off he
could run by a cross-cut and perhaps make
the bull forget Peletiah. Then he swung his
arms, and made an awful noise. The bull
didn’t like this a bit better, for here were two
impudent boys instead of one. So he stopped
just a second, trying to decide which one to go
for first, and Peletiah, turning, for once in his
life was anything but slow in the way he made
for the fence. This decided the bull, who
now gave his whole attention to Joel, and the
small boy pattering after.</p>

<p>“Run for the fence, Dave,” shouted Joel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
zigzagging from right to left, trying to confuse
the bull, who now was getting thoroughly mad.</p>

<p>David gave one dreadful scream in the direction
of a man, off in the road where Peletiah
was now safe. But he didn’t run for the
fence; on the contrary, he did just what Joel
was doing, darted first to right, then to left,
so that between the two boys the bull was
troubled in his mind which one to toss up toward
the sky.</p>

<p>The first thing either of them knew, somebody
was saying, “I’ll take care of the bull—run
for the fence!” and a tall figure was dashing
in to the thick of things and swinging his
hat.</p>

<p>By this time, the bull didn’t know where he
was nor what course to pursue. And before
any of them quite knew it, Joel and David were
over the fence, and the tall man was bending
over them where they had tumbled flat down on
their faces in the grass.</p>

<p>“Well, little chap, I’ve paid my debt to you,”
he was saying, bending over David. But
David was beyond hearing anything, having
fainted clear away. So the tall young man
took him and carried him across the road where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
there was a little thread of a stream of water
that ran away by itself from the brook, Joel
stumbling after, picking out the grass that flew
in his mouth as he tumbled off from the fence.</p>

<p>“Now then,” the tall young man smiled as
David opened his eyes, “little chap, you’re coming
round all right,” and he wrung the water
out of his handkerchief, with which he had
bathed the small, white face.</p>

<p>And David looked up into the eyes of the
visitor who had come uninvited to Mr. Atkins’
store, to go afterward to Cherryville jail.</p>

<p>The color came flying back into David’s
cheeks, and he sat straight.</p>

<p>“Did they hurt you there?” he cried anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said the young man.
“I’m just out to-day. Good luck for you,”
he said under his breath.</p>

<p>The old bull, very angry that the cows should
see his discomfiture, was snorting and pawing
the earth over in the meadow. David shivered
and hid his eyes on the young man’s
sleeve.</p>

<p>Joel, who hadn’t taken his gaze from the
stranger, crowded up as closely as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Who are you, Mr. Man?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you ever hear of a fellow who tried
to rob the store in Badgertown?” asked the
stranger, fixing his keen eyes on him.</p>

<p>Joel tumbled back, “Are you the burglar?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t take anything,” cried Davie
hastily.</p>

<p>“Good reason why. This little chap
wouldn’t let me,” said the young man. Then
he laughed.</p>

<p>“And you—you jumped in front of the
bull,” gasped Joel.</p>

<p>“That was easy enough,” said the young
man. “I couldn’t have this little chap hurt.
He was good to me, and didn’t want me to
be hurt.”</p>

<p>“I think you are a good burglar, Mr. Man,”
said Joel, crowding up closely. “I said I’d
have smashed you if I’d been there in the
store—but I don’t want to now.”</p>

<p>The young man burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“I could have done it,” said Joel, very much
nettled at the laugh—and he doubled up his
small fists.</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say,” said the young man, wiping
his eyes. Then he saw Joel’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Well, you have got a pair of fists, to be sure!”
he declared admiringly.</p>

<p>Joel spread his little brown hands, then
doubled them up again and flirted them in the
air, very much pleased.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said the young man. “Well
now, don’t use them any more than you can
help. Good luck to you, little chap,” he turned
to David, and was gone down the road.</p>

<p>“I wish he hadn’t gone,” mourned David,
looking after him. “Perhaps he would have
come with us to Mamsie.”</p>

<p>That made Joel think of the two fish-poles
and the big fish. “I must get them,” he said,
springing up. Just then down the road that he
had struck from the wood-path came Ezekiel,
who didn’t find it so pleasant, after all, being
alone. He was carrying all the things, even
the tin can that had one worm in it.</p>

<p>Peletiah, long before this at the parsonage,
was sitting on the back steps. Having run
every step of the way home, a thing he couldn’t
remember ever doing in his life before, he still
sat thinking it all over. It didn’t seem quite
so nice a thing to do, to carry the tale into
the parson’s study, as at first it had appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
to him. And when he thought of the bull, as
Joel’s cry had warned him, he ducked his head
down between his arms. And although he had
seen the young man save the situation, he
couldn’t forget Joel waving his arms, and telling
him to “run for the fence.”</p>

<p>Joel was occupied for the next few hours
after reaching the little brown house and the
story all through with, in pretending he was
the bull and dashing after imaginary persons;
and then when tired of that, he said he
was going to be the burglar.</p>

<p>“Don’t call him that,” begged David, who
had shivered all through Joel’s performance.
“Mamsie, please don’t let Joel call him that.”</p>

<p>“No, Joel, you mustn’t,” said Mrs. Pepper;
“say, instead, ‘How good he was!’”</p>

<p>“He said I had good fists,” said Joel, doubling
up his little brown hands to view them
affectionately.</p>

<p>“Fists are to be used only when you are
sure it is right to do so,” said Mrs. Pepper.
“Remember that, Joey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hello!” Joel, at last obliged to drop
his imaginary performances as a bull, had
run out to pick up some kindlings. By the side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
of the woodshed he ran against a boy. It was
Peletiah.</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell my father and my mother you
wouldn’t let me get on my big stone,” he said.</p>

<p>“It was my stone,” declared Joel, squaring
up to him. “I got on it first.”</p>

<p>“You got off of it,” said Peletiah, “and that
made it mine when I got on.”</p>

<p>“I was coming back when I got Davie’s fish-hook
fixed,” said Joel stubbornly. “It was
<i>my</i> big stone.”</p>

<p>“It was mine, and you came up and
scrouged,” said Peletiah, bobbing his tow head
obstinately.</p>

<p>“I wish your father would preach at you,
and preach at you every single Sunday,” cried
Joel vindictively, kicking his rusty little shoe
in the dirt.</p>

<p>“My father doesn’t preach at us,” cried Peletiah
calmly. “He preaches at other people.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish a bear would come out of
the woods and eat you,” said Joel.</p>

<p>Peletiah looked all about him, his glance even
taking in the hills ranging about Badgertown.
“There aren’t any bears around here,” he said
calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Well, maybe they could come from somewhere
else,” said Joel, his round face brightening.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Pepper appeared in the doorway,
and David just behind her. “Peletiah,
you are just the one I want to see,” she cried.
She had a blue plate covered with a napkin in
her hand. “Now, David, you tell him,” looking
down at him. But David hung back. So
Mamsie had to do it for him. “David wants
you to take half of this nice big fish to your
mother, as Ezekiel is going to give his to your
father.” She came down from the step, and
put the plate in his hand.</p>

<p>Peletiah, standing quite still, looked at the
blue plate covered with the napkin. Then he
moved off slowly. Joel ran after him.</p>

<p>“I don’t want the bears to eat you,” he said.</p>

<p>“And you can have the big stone if you want
it,” said Peletiah.</p>

<small>“POLLY KISSED IT!” SAID DAVIE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“YES, it beat all,” said Mr. Atkins,
“how he come in and begun looking
around—”</p>

<p>“You mean th’ Doctor,” interrupted Deacon
Blodgett, reaching over for a scrap of
cheese to put on his cracker. He knew the
story, having heard it a good dozen times, but
he wanted some of the other ears to be introduced
to it.</p>

<p>“Who am I a-talkin’ of, ef ’tain’t Doctor
Fisher?” said Mr. Atkins irritably.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the Deacon, helping himself
to another cracker to top off the cheese.</p>

<p>It had just begun to drizzle, the light rain
keeping customers within the store, and at such
a time Mr. Atkins opened his cracker-box and
laid out his cheese-knife. He was delighted
at the chance of village gossip, and besides they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
would all more than make up by their orders
for the price of the entertainment.</p>

<p>“Yes, he come in, and he looked around this
way and that, an’ I kep’ still, for th’ Doctor, you
all know, has a way of his own, an’ he would
explain in good time, an’ pretty soon he says,
‘Ain’t any Pepper children around, hey?’</p>

<p>“An’ I says ‘No,’ an’ he took one more good
look, for he says, ‘I’m not so sure about Joel,
for he can get everywhere in just about a
minute,’ an’ I says, ‘Yes, I know <i>that</i>, but Joel
is to home, for he came tearin’ in here half an
hour ago, an’ he said he must hurry an’ git some
corn meal, for he’d got to help Polly.’ An’ I
waited on him quick, I tell you, an’ he tore off.</p>

<p>“‘I guess I’m safe then—’ said Dr. Fisher.
‘Well, I want to see a stove.’</p>

<p>“‘A stove!’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘I said a stove,’ said Dr. Fisher, quite
calm. ‘Come now, let’s see if you’ve got one
to suit.’</p>

<p>“‘I’ve got a perfec’ beauty,’ says I, an’ so I
had—ordered a new one for old Miss Pringle
an’ then she didn’t take it—said her old one
acted better after all, an’ she’d concluded to try
it a spell longer. So me an’ th’ Doctor went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
out to the ‘Extension’ [the shed where the
storekeeper kept his stoves when he had any,
and the pots and pans required by the village
housekeepers]. ‘Ain’t that splendid?’ says I,
pointing to it.</p>

<p>“Th’ Doctor danced around that stove—you
know how he steps off on the tips of his
toes when he’s pleased—an’ set his spectacles
a dozen times to get a better view, an’ finally he
says, ‘Don’t you s’pose she’d like it?’ I never
see him so anxious about anythin’.</p>

<p>“‘Why don’t you get your sister to come
an’ pick it out for herself?’ I says, finally.
He kep’ a-dancin’ around so.</p>

<p>“‘’Tain’t for my sister,’ he says; ‘it’s for
Polly Pepper.’</p>

<p>“‘O my land!’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, it would go to any one’s heart to see
that little girl.’</p>

<p>“Dr. Fisher stopped dancing and faced me
quite severe. ‘Why—well, I don’t know
what to say when I think of her. An’ now her
eyes—’</p>

<p>“Well then, th’ Doctor whips out that big
handkerchief of his, an’ he blows his nose—pretended
he’d got an awful cold—till you’d’a’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
thought ’twas Gabriel’s trump, an’ then he says,
‘I’m goin’ to send her a new stove in place of
that broken-down old thing that Ben stuffs up
with putty, an’—’</p>

<p>“An’ I says, ‘O my land, I didn’t know
that!’ an’ I was all struck of a heap to think
I might ’a’ give Polly a stove, an’ eased up
things a mite for the little-brown-house folks,
an’ th’ Doctor grabs my arm, an’ he says, ‘It’s
to be kep’ quite secret. Be sure, Atkins, you
don’t let a soul know,’—an’ I said I wouldn’t,
cross my heart, an’ all that. An’ then I put
my foot in it, for I says, ‘Let me give half o’
that stove, Doctor.’</p>

<p>“I tell you, he was real mad then. Did you
ever see th’ little Doctor mad? Well, he
swelled up till he actually looked big, an’ his
eyes—my gracious! they was so fierce, I says,
‘’Xcuse me,’ an’ then he ca’med down, an’
told me th’ stove was to go that afternoon.
An’ then he paid me, an’ bolted out as if he’d
ben caught doin’ somethin’ bad.”</p>

<p>“Hem!” Deacon Blodgett snipped off another
crumb of cheese, looking around to see
the effect on the group.</p>

<p>A woman over behind the sugar-barrel burst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
out, “He’s awful good, Dr. Fisher is. He
cured my Jenny of pneumony, an’ he never
took a cent o’ pay for it.” She wiped her eyes
with her apron.</p>

<p>“Beats all how he takes care o’ those old-maid
sisters o’ his’n,” broke in Farmer Jones.
“It’s bad enough to have one old maid fastened
on you—but two—” he gave a long
whistle, “that’s worse’n pisen.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe th’ Lord’ll let him shift ’em pretty
soon—they do say there’s a rich wid’wer over
to Stockton shinin’ up to Sarah, an’ that’ll be a
chance for th’ Doctor to get free.”</p>

<p>“Hoh! well, Sarah ain’t Laviny, an’ she’s
homely as a hedge-fence.”</p>

<p>“Sarah Fisher always said whoever took her,
must take Laviny, too. They hain’t never ben
separated, an’ they never will be.”</p>

<p>“Hoh!” said Farmer Jones again. “Well,
th’ little Pepper gal didn’t go blind, after all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins pounded on the counter with his
red fist, so that the group jumped. “<i>Blind!</i>”
he roared, “Polly Pepper blind? Well, I guess
not. Th’ Lord wouldn’t let sech a thing happen,
an’ so He got Dr. Fisher to take care of
her eyes. Oh, my soul an’ body! there’s somethin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
in th’ world for that girl to do. I dunno
what ’tis, but she’s got to have a pair o’ eyes
to do it with.”</p>

<p>“Hem!” said Deacon Blodgett again.
“Well, now do tell us how th’ stove got there,
Atkins.”</p>

<p>“You’d orter hear Davie tell it,” the storekeeper
chuckled with glee, and rubbed his hands
together—then chuckled again. “I made him
go over it one day—you know he helps me
keep store.”</p>

<p>“What, that scrap of a boy? You’re jokin’,
Atkins,” said one of the men.</p>

<p>“I ain’t jokin’, Tom,” Mr. Atkins drew
himself up and declared; “Davie may be a
scrap of a boy, but he’s worth more’n some
men. An’ it beats all how he can tell th’ truth.
An’ I never see nothin’ like it for manners he
has—he can keep shop real elegant,” the
storekeeper wound up in pride.</p>

<p>“Somethin’ different from Joel,” laughed
Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Joel’s all right,” declared Mr.
Atkins.</p>

<p>“I’d ruther have Joel,” said Tom. “David
is such a meek little mouse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“David Pepper ain’t sech a meek little mouse
as you think,” said Mr. Atkins decidedly.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Farmer Jones. “Remember
the burglar in this very shop here, Tom.”</p>

<p>“To be sure!” said Tom, “I forgot that he
was th’ boy.”</p>

<p>“Them two boys is as diffrunt as can be,”
said the storekeeper, “but they can’t be beat,
neither one on ’em. And don’t you never let
any one call David a meek little mouse, Tom
Sanders. He’s little, but he’s got a mighty lot
o’ grit aboard. Why, here he comes now!”
he cried joyfully.</p>

<p>Every one whirled around as the door opened
and David Pepper walked in.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Davie,” said Mr. Atkins, as
David went up to the counter, “so you came to
help me keep store, did you? Why, I didn’t
’xpect you to-day, as it rains. Well, I’m glad
you’ve come though.”</p>

<p>“I can sweep up the ell,” said Davie, “that
you said yesterday I was to do this morning,”
and he hurried off for the broom.</p>

<p>“So I did—so I did,” replied the storekeeper,
“an’ that made you come in the rain?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Yes,” said David, his mind intent on the
broom and the dust-pan.</p>

<p>“Well, see here—hold on a bit,” called
Mr. Atkins. “Come here, David. Now—”
as David hurried back, “I want you to tell us
how the stove Dr. Fisher gave Polly got to the
little brown house as a surprise. Set up on
th’ sugar-barrel an’ tell us, Davie.”</p>

<p>All the color in David’s body seemed to
rush into his little round cheek, as he stood
there holding the broom. He looked helplessly
around, and his eyes fastened on Deacon Blodgett
pleadingly.</p>

<p>“I would, Davie,” said the Deacon kindly.
“It’s a rainy day an’ we’d like to hear it—an’
’twould make us like th’ Doctor better.”</p>

<p>To make everybody “like th’ Doctor better”
seemed to Davie a thing to do. Every
bit of the color went out of his cheeks. He
set down the broom, and with a catch in his
breath, he mounted the sugar-barrel and folded
his hands in his lap.</p>

<p>“Dr. Fisher gave Polly the stove,” he began
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Mr. Atkins quickly. “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
all know that, Davie. Now tell us all about
how it got into the little brown house an’ was
set up. Begin at th’ very beginnin’, Davie.”</p>

<p>“I would, Davie,” said Deacon Blodgett
encouragingly.</p>

<p>David drew a long breath and began again—while
the circle crowded up around the sugar-barrel.</p>

<p>“Mamsie told us to stay in the bedroom, and
to play something. She said we might make
just as much noise as we wanted to, for Polly
mustn’t hear things in th’ kitchen, and we
mustn’t come out until she called us. And
Polly said, ‘Oh, can’t we play in the kitchen because
the bedroom is so small?’ and we
wanted to play ‘Old Father Dubbin,’ because
Phronsie—”</p>

<p>“Who’s old Father Dubbin?” interrupted
Tom, the young farmer.</p>

<p>“He isn’t anybody,” said Davie, shaking his
head. “Polly made him up, and we play him
when she lets us.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Tom, “I thought ’twas somebody
in Badgertown—new folks, mebbe,
who’d moved in.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Davie,” begged the woman, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
daughter Jenny had been cured of pneumonia
by Dr. Fisher, and she pressed further
into the circle.</p>

<p>“Mamsie said, ‘No, Polly, you must all stay
in the bedroom until I call you,’ and Mamsie
patted Polly’s head, on top of the bandage,
and—”</p>

<p>“Bandage?” repeated another of the men
in the listening group.</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t you see Polly’s eyes were tied
up.” Davie’s voice trembled, and he had hard
work, as the remembrance of it all swept over
him, to keep the tears back.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot,” said the man, “she was
blind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, <i>no</i>!” cried David in a sharp little
cry, and he tried to spring from the barrel.
Oh, couldn’t he get home to Polly, and hold her
close and forget that she had ever had her
eyes tied up! Then the tears came.</p>

<p>Deacon Blodgett laid both large hands on
the small lad. “Well, Davie, you know she
wasn’t blind,” he said in a hearty voice.</p>

<p>“No, she wasn’t,” said Davie, smiling
through his tears.</p>

<p>“Now tell how the stove got in,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
Jenny’s mother, with a black look for the man
who had said “blind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell us,” they all took it up.</p>

<p>“Well, we were playing Old Father Dubbin,”
Davie had wiped his tears on the big
handkerchief that Deacon Blodgett laid in his
lap, “and Polly she was ‘Old Father Dubbin,’”
then he laughed, “and she had almost caught
Joel, when we heard an awful big noise out
in the kitchen, and Joel said he was going out
there.”</p>

<p>“I reckoned you wouldn’t keep Joel in,”
laughed one of the men.</p>

<p>“Oh, he didn’t run out,” Davie hurried to
say, and he shook his light waves of hair convincingly.
“Joel stopped wanting to go out
when Polly said ‘No, you mustn’t—Mamsie
said we were to stay here.’ And then Ben
came in. Mamsie kept him in the kitchen, and
he had a big stick—oh, as big as this,” David
spread his arms, “and he said he wanted to
be Old Father Dubbin, and Polly said she was
glad, and Ben pounded on the floor, and chased
us all, and I got under Mamsie’s bed, and
Phronsie, too.” Here Davie gave a gleeful
laugh that showed all his little white teeth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
“And Joel chased Ben and tried to get the
stick, and Polly laughed and clapped her hands
and said, ‘Old Father Dubbin will get you,
Joey!’—and it was awfully nice.” Davie
drew a long breath and clasped his hands
ecstatically.</p>

<p>“Well, now, the stove,” Jenny’s mother
pressed closer; “tell about Dr. Fisher’s stove.”</p>

<p>Davie’s blue eyes shone as he continued,
“And then the door opened, and Mamsie came
in, and she said, ‘Come, children—why,
where are Davie and Phronsie?’ and Joel said,
‘They’re under the bed,’ and Mamsie laughed
and said, ‘Wait, till they come out, for we must
all go into the kitchen together.’ And Joel
helped Phronsie out, and Ben said, ‘Well, Old
Father Dubbin has got you, Dave,’ and he
pulled me out by the legs.” Here Davie
laughed long and loud, and it sounded so gleeful
that everybody joined in till the old store
rang with the noise, and Mrs. Atkins ran in,
her sweeping-cap on her head, to see what
could be the matter.</p>

<p>When she found that Davie Pepper on the
sugar-barrel was telling something, she joined
herself to the group, in time to hear him say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
“And Joel cried, ‘It’s a <i>sto</i>—’ and Mamsie
said, ‘Hush, Joel!’—and Ben said, ‘Don’t
you dare to say a word, Joe Pepper!’—and
Polly said, ‘Oh, what <i>is</i> it, Mamsie?’ and
Mamsie said, ‘Children, be quiet.’ And Joel
stuffed the towel in his mouth, and we all were
still as mice, and Polly said, ‘Oh, I do wish I
could see!’” Here Davie’s face became very
grave, and his voice fell.</p>

<p>“Well, she did see,” said Deacon Blodgett
in a loud voice. “Now, hurry and tell us,
Davie boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she did,” said Davie, bobbing his
light, wavy hair till it fell over his forehead
again, and the smile ran up his round cheeks.
“Mamsie said, ‘Now, Polly, I’m going to take
off your bandage.’ And she did!” Davie
drew a long breath and clasped his hands.
“And the stove was there!” he cried; “Dr.
Fisher’s stove was there—it was—it was!”
He sprang off from the sugar-barrel, made his
way through the group, and ran over to the
farther end of the store, all the circle whirling
around to watch him; “just like this, in the
corner,” he got down on his knees and patted
the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“What did Polly do?” cried Jenny’s mother
in an awe-struck voice.</p>

<p>David hopped to his feet, and flung back
the soft waves of hair that had tumbled over
his forehead again, and faced them all with
shining eyes. “Polly kissed it!” he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>JOEL’S COMPANY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“NOW, Davie,” said Mrs. Pepper, “you
must be Mother’s good boy and not feel
badly because Joel cannot go.”</p>

<p>“I very much wish Joel could go,” said
Davie, gazing out of the window disconsolately.
“Oh, why couldn’t good Mrs.
Brown have asked Joel, too!”</p>

<p>“Joel must stay at home with Polly—you
wouldn’t have Polly left alone, Davie, when
Ben is to help Deacon Blodgett.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Davie, shaking his head, “but
if Polly could go, too.”</p>

<p>“That would be a big company on Mrs.
Brown’s hands,” said Mrs. Pepper, with a
little laugh. “Now, Davie, set to work and
do all the things Polly wants you to do to-day,
for to-morrow morning Mr. Brown is coming
for us bright and early.”</p>

<p>David turned away from the window. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
was going to sigh, but seeing Mother Pepper’s
face, he smiled instead.</p>

<p>“What can I do, Polly?” he cried, running
up to her.</p>

<p>Polly had her head all tied up in Mother
Pepper’s big sweeping-cap. “Let me see,”
she paused on her way for the broom. “Oh,
you might clean out the ‘Provision Room,’
Davie.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Davie, hurrying out to the
woodshed to get the old broom, a rough wisp
of a thing almost worn down to the handle.
But it was good enough for the Provision
Room.</p>

<p>“And I should think the potatoes needed
looking over,” said Mrs. Pepper, on her way
to the bedroom.</p>

<p>“I’ll do ’em, too,” said Davie.</p>

<p>“You better do the potatoes first,” said
Polly, picking off her broom from its nail in
the corner, “before you sweep the ‘Provision
Room’ out, Davie.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Davie, hurrying out to
the woodshed.</p>

<p>“Come, Phronsie, you and I must stay in
the bedroom while Polly sweeps up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
kitchen.” Mrs. Pepper picked up her big work
basket from the table.</p>

<p>“I shall sew on my child’s dress to wear to
my Mrs. Brown’s to-morrow,” hummed Phronsie,
gathering up Seraphina and some scraps of
calico and getting up from the kitchen floor
to patter after her mother.</p>

<p>“O dear me!” Polly leaned on the broom-handle
as the bedroom door was shut;
“why can’t I ever go to spend the day somewhere?”</p>

<p>Two tears rolled down from the brown eyes
and wet the broom-handle.</p>

<p>“They’ve got chickens and pigs, Mrs. Brown
said so—and there’s a cunning little brook
back of the farm-yard. Why can’t I go?”</p>

<p>Away went the old broom with a clang to
the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>The bedroom door opened and Phronsie’s
yellow head appeared.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a noise—Oh, Polly, are
you hurt?” she cried.</p>

<p>“No,” Polly rushed over to the broom and
picked it up. Her cheeks were very red.
“Don’t come out, Phronsie,—I’m all right.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” said Phronsie anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“Sure as I can be,” declared Polly. “Do
go back—O dear!” With a glance to see
that the bedroom door really was shut, Polly
rushed over to Mamsie’s old calico-covered
chair, and flung herself, broom and all, down
before it.</p>

<p>“I’m the worst girl that ever lived,” she
cried, stuffing her fingers up before her mouth.
Suppose Phronsie should open the bedroom
door again!</p>

<p>Just then a mouse over in the corner gave a
scratch against the wainscot. Polly hopped to
her feet, afraid it was the bedroom door, and
wiped her eyes on the end of the sweeping-cap,
that flapped down over her shoulder. Then
she tucked it up, and began to send the broom
flying over the dust and crumbs on the kitchen
floor. Joel ran in and found her so.</p>

<p>“Polly,” he began wrathfully, “why can’t
we go to Mrs. Brown’s house to-morrow?
Why can’t we, Polly?” He laid hold of the
broom-handle, so that she had to stop chasing
the dust and crumbs.</p>

<p>“Because Mrs. Brown didn’t ask us,” said
Polly coolly. “Let go of the broom, Joe. I
can’t sweep when you do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“Well, why didn’t she ask us?” demanded
Joel in a louder key.</p>

<p>“Hush—Mamsie will hear you,” warned
Polly, pointing to the door. “Because she
didn’t want us.”</p>

<p>“She ought to want us,” Joel dropped
his voice, but his black eyes blazed in
indignation.</p>

<p>Polly burst into a little laugh. “When
folks have company they can ask any one they
want, and not ask any one they don’t want.”</p>

<p>“Not a single one?” persisted Joel, still
hanging to the broom.</p>

<p>“No; not if they don’t want to,” said Polly.
“Now, you <i>must</i> let go of the broom.”</p>

<p>When Polly said “must” in that tone, the
little Peppers knew that it was time to obey;
So Joel’s brown hands dropped from the broom-handle,
and down to his side.</p>

<p>“Then they’ll be very mad—the folks who
don’t get asked,” he said slowly.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Polly lightly, and making
some of the scraps from Mamsie’s sewing on
the coats, fly neatly away from the broom,
“but what good would that do, Joey—they
couldn’t go, all the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>Joel stood quite still and swallowed the lump
in his throat.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to go, Polly?” he blurted
out.</p>

<p>Polly turned her head, and tried to laugh.
“Maybe,” she said.</p>

<p>“You do,” cried Joel triumphantly, “want
to go awfully. There’s pigs and chickens
there, and lots and lots of things, Polly Pepper!
I’m going! I’ll get on behind the wagon,
when Mr. Brown doesn’t know it. Oh, Polly,
you come, too—I’ll help you!” He spun
round and round her, broom and all.</p>

<p>“Joel Pepper!” cried Polly, quite aghast,
and whirling with him, to lay hold of his
jacket-sleeve. “Stop! Oh, Joel, aren’t you
ashamed to want to go when you’re not
invited?”</p>

<p>“You said you wanted to,” cried Joel, trying
to get away. But she held him fast.</p>

<p>“I said ‘Maybe.’” The hot color rushed
over Polly’s face at the remembrance.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the same thing,” declared Joel
with another twitch.</p>

<p>“Joel,” said Polly, and she threw down the
broom. “Come outdoors—” and still holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
his sleeve, she hurried him out and into
the woodshed. “Now see here, I was a bad
girl to want to go.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a bad boy to want to go,” contradicted
Joel stoutly.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are; we’re both bad,” declared
Polly; “don’t you see, it’s naughty to want
something that Mamsie can’t get for us, and
just think how she would feel if she knew it.”</p>

<p>Polly drew a long breath, and her hand
shook that held to the sleeve.</p>

<p>Joel scrubbed his rusty little shoe on the
woodshed floor. “Mrs. Brown is bad,” he
said. “She ought to have asked us.”</p>

<p>“Stop saying that,” said Polly. “And
when you have company, you can ask any one
you want to.”</p>

<p>“I shall ask everybody,” declared Joel with
a generous sweep of his hands, “just every
single bit of folks.” His face brightened,
“Polly, can’t I ever have company?”</p>

<p>“Goodness, no!” cried Polly, and she burst
into a laugh; “the idea of our having company
in the little brown house—Joey Pepper!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have ’em in the house—they
could stay outdoors, in the orchard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>“Well, I think we’d both better get back to
our work instead of standing here to talk about
having company,” said Polly gaily. Then she
stopped. “Why, Joel, perhaps you <i>could</i>
have some company to-morrow. I do believe
Mamsie would let you, after all.”</p>

<p>“Can I—can I?” cried Joel eagerly, and
prancing all about her.</p>

<p>“I almost know that she will let you ask—”</p>

<p>“Who?” interrupted Joel with a gasp.</p>

<p>“Peletiah and Ezekiel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want them,” howled Joel, horribly
disappointed.</p>

<p>“Well, now you see,” said Polly; “Mrs.
Brown doesn’t want us, and you think she
ought to. Now here’s a chance for you to
ask somebody you don’t want to.”</p>

<p>Joel puckered up his round cheeks and ran
off to the corner of the woodshed. “Have I
got to?” he asked, coming slowly back with a
wry face.</p>

<p>“No,” said Polly coolly; “only you think
Mrs. Brown is bad not to ask us.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mamsie won’t let ’em come,” he
said, a comforting thought striking him.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she will,” said Polly cheerfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
“I heard her only the other day talk about
asking them some time. And the Parson and
Mrs. Henderson have been <i>so good</i> to us, Joey!
Come, let’s go and ask her now.”</p>

<p>She grasped his jacket-sleeve and he had
nothing to do but to follow.</p>

<p>“O dear me!” exclaimed Polly, as she saw
the broom lying just where she had thrown it.
“Well, it won’t take a minute to ask Mamsie
about your company, Joe, and then I’ll finish
sweeping the kitchen,” and she threw wide the
bedroom door.</p>

<p>There sat Phronsie on the floor at Mrs. Pepper’s
feet, snipping up what she called the
“trimming” to Seraphina’s new calico gown,
and humming softly to herself as Mamsie set
the stitches in the coat, a happy smile on her
face. For pleasure was coming to two of her
little ones to-morrow through the kindness of
good Mr. and Mrs. Brown. When she saw
Joel’s face, the smile dropped off a bit, as she
remembered how he wanted to go on the beautiful
visit. And Polly, too! Then the smile
faded completely away.</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” cried Polly, rushing in and towing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
Joel along, “can’t Joey have some company
to-morrow; can’t he, Mamsie?”</p>

<p>“Some company?” repeated Mother Pepper,
her work dropping to her lap.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Polly, “oh, it would be so
nice—Peletiah and Ezekiel—can’t he ask
them?”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” said Joel. He couldn’t help it, and
he twisted up his face, just as if he’d bitten
something sour.</p>

<p>“You said you’d like to ask them some time,
Mamsie,” went on Polly, still holding Joel’s little
calico sleeve fast, “and now Joey and I will
be all alone—and he wants some company.”</p>

<p>Mamsie turned her black eyes on Joel’s face.
“If Joel wants them to come, I shall be very
glad. But not unless he does want them,” she
finished slowly.</p>

<p>Joel put his little brown hands together
tightly, and looked down on the floor. “Peletiah
can’t play anything,” he blurted out
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Well, Ezekiel can,” said Polly brightly.</p>

<p>“Huh!” exclaimed Joel contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll play ‘Old Father Dubbin,’”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
said Polly; “that’ll <i>make</i> him play, Joey,” and
she gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>“Will you play ‘Old Father Dubbin’?”
cried Joel, looking up, and he began to laugh
too.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” promised Polly, bobbing
her head so that the two brown braids flew out,
“and we’ll have the best party that you ever
saw, Joel Pepper!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a party, Phronsie,” Joel
twitched away from Polly’s grasp on his jacket
sleeve, and flew over to her, “all by myself—I
am,” he cried, dreadfully excited—and giving
her a bear hug.</p>

<p>“Take care, Joel—mind the scissors!”
warned Mrs. Pepper. Too late! Phronsie,
having great difficulty in making one part of
the scissors stay on her fat little thumb, was
just holding them up, while she wriggled her
fingers into the other part, when down came
Joel upon them.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t anything—I don’t care,” he said,
bobbing up, wiping away the blood with the
back of one small hand. But it came dripping
down his face just as fast. Mrs. Pepper
with never a word, gathered him up to her lap.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
Then she said, “The bowl of water, Polly.”</p>

<p>Polly had stood like a frozen little thing.
“His eye—Mamsie!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“I said the bowl of water, Polly,” repeated
Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>How she got the bowl of water, and then a
towel, Polly never knew. All she was conscious
of was standing holding the bowl while
Mamsie washed away the blood, Joel all the
while saying, “’Tisn’t anything—I don’t
care—a single bit.”</p>

<p>At last Joel’s black eye shone out clear and
strong. Mrs. Pepper gave a deep cry of joy—and
clasped her boy tighter to her breast.</p>

<p>Down flopped Polly in a little heap on the
floor, the bowl coming with a thud that
splashed the water over the rim.</p>

<p>“You’re spilling all the water, Polly Pepper!”
exclaimed Joel, struggling away from
Mother Pepper to look down at her, amazement
all over his bloody little face. “Just see
there, Mamsie, she’s spilt the water all over
the floor!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamsie,” breathed Polly, clasping her
hands on her mother’s knee, “it isn’t Joel’s
eye—it isn’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>Mrs. Pepper’s white lips moved. She tried
to say, “God is good,” but the words not coming,
she smiled instead.</p>

<p>“It didn’t hurt any,” declared Joel stoutly,
brushing off more blood from an ugly little
cut just below one of those bright black eyes.</p>

<p>“Take care, Joey,” said Mother Pepper—holding
his brown hands; “now you must just
sit still. Polly, you better run and see if Dr.
Fisher can come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want Dr. Fisher to come,” cried
Joel in great alarm. “He’ll put me to bed,
and make me have the measles all over again.
Don’t let him come, Mamsie!” he begged.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t have the measles again,
Joel,” said Polly, getting up on her feet, and
picking up the bowl.</p>

<p>“Can’t I?” said Joel.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Polly decidedly; “the
very idea, Joel Pepper!” and she gave a gay
little laugh. Joel’s eye wasn’t hurt, and Dr.
Fisher was coming. Everything would soon
be all right!</p>

<p>Phronsie, who didn’t really know that the
scissors had done anything naughty to Joel’s
face, was still struggling to keep them on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
fat little hand enough to snip away at the
“trimming.” She began now, in a soft little
voice, to talk to Seraphina lying on the floor
by her side.</p>

<p>“You are going to have a new dress, my
child, to wear to-morrow to dear Mrs. Brown’s,
and you may see the little chickies, and the dear,
sweet little pigs.”</p>

<p>“Then he can come,” said Joel on a high
key, “if he won’t put me to bed and make me
have the measles again,” while Polly sped out,
and on the wings of the wind, over to get good
Dr. Fisher.</p>

<p>The little Doctor was soon there, and mending
Joel’s face, who kept saying it didn’t hurt,
as he twisted his hands tightly together.
When it was all over, he looked out over the
plasters and bandage on his round face, and
announced very pompously, “I’m going to
have company to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Are you?” said Dr. Fisher.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” said Joel, with an important
air, and beginning to get down from Mrs.
Pepper’s lap. “Mamsie said I might, and I
must go and ask ’em now.”</p>

<p>“Hold on there!” the little Doctor put forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
a restraining hand. “I guess I’d put off that
company of yours, Joe, to another day.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said Joel, wriggling to get down
to the floor. “I must go now and ask ’em.
It’s my party I’m going to have while Mamsie
and Dave and Phronsie are over at Mrs.
Brown’s.”</p>

<p>“Is that it?” said Dr. Fisher. “Well now,
see here, Joe,” he began, while he laid both
hands on the struggling little legs.</p>

<p>“And we’re going to play ‘Old Father Dubbin’,”
cried Joel. “Polly said we may—Oh,
let me <i>go</i>!” He kicked and squirmed, but it
was no use;—at last he sat quite still and
glared at the little Doctor.</p>

<p>“Who ever heard of giving a party with a
head tied up like yours?” Dr. Fisher burst
into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tear the things off,” declared
Joel, vindictively, and preparing to begin the
work.</p>

<p>“Look here, Joe,” Dr. Fisher’s eyes were
now so stern behind their big spectacles that
Joel’s small brown hands fell to his lap. “Just
look at your mother!”</p>

<p>Joel whirled around in Mrs. Pepper’s lap, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
peered at her over his plaster and bandages.
“Mamsie, I won’t have my company,” he said
humbly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will, Joey,” she said brightly,
“you shall have a beautiful time. It’s only
put off!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>AT FARMER BROWN’S</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SO it was a whole week after when Farmer
Brown got Mrs. Pepper and Davie and
Phronsie into the big wagon all ready to start
for Maybury. Mother Pepper sat on the back
seat with the farmer’s wife, who insisted on
holding Phronsie on her lap,—and Davie, who
would have been in a state of bliss if only
Joel were going, sat very straight next to
Farmer Brown waiting till all the good-bys
were over and he could say “G’lang” to the
old white horse.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have company,” announced
Joel importantly, for about the fiftieth time,
and climbing up on the wheel to tell it to Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>“So I’ve heerd,” said the farmer dryly.</p>

<p>“I am—all by myself,” declared Joel, his
black eyes shining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“Well, you better get off th’ wheel then,”
said Mr. Brown, “for your comp’ny folks may
be a-comin’ down th’ road.”</p>

<p>At that Joel leaped down and ran till he
could see the turn in the road; then came flying
back.</p>

<p>“They’re not coming—not a single bit,”
he declared in an injured tone.</p>

<p>“Well, you keep off th’ wheel,” said the
farmer, “for if Jingo starts, mebbe your leg
would be sliced off.”</p>

<p>Joel, with no heed to such a direful warning,
ran around to look with new interest at
the old white horse.</p>

<p>“Is that his name?” he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>“Mebbe,” said the farmer. “Sometimes
when I want him to hoof it real fast, I say
‘By Jingo.’”</p>

<p>“And does he—does he go real fast?”
said Joel, trying to climb up on the old white
back.</p>

<p>“You get off that horse!” roared the farmer
at him, in such an awful voice that Joel lost
no time in slipping down on his two small feet.
Mr. Brown cast a despairing glance over his
shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>“I’m a-goin’ to start,” he said, gathering up
the reins.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Pa,” Mrs. Brown leaned
over Phronsie in her lap. “Be careful o’ th’
custard pie,” she said, in a loud whisper, “it’s
kinder soft.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Polly, her brown eyes dancing
at the thought of this splendid addition to
Joel’s party. “I put it up on the top shelf of
the cupboard, so he can’t see it till the time
comes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown’s large face beamed approval.</p>

<p>“<i>G’lang!</i>” cried the farmer, snapping his
whip, and they were finally off, Joel clattering
down the dusty road a piece to see if he
couldn’t beat them to the corner.</p>

<p>The old house at Maybury stood back a
good bit from the road. Mrs. Pepper gave a
sigh of delight as Jingo turned into the yard,
and stopped before the big porch. Honeysuckle
rambled all over it, and hollyhocks shot
up their tall stocks,—and lilac-bushes and
poplars guarded the doorway, the approach
being bordered by rows of box, years and
years old.</p>

<p>A big dog got slowly up from the flat door-stone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
shook himself, and came up to the
wagon. Phronsie gave a little cry and sprang
over to get into Mother Pepper’s lap.</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife held to her. “He
wouldn’t hurt you,” she said; “why, you’ll be
playin’ with him as soon as you get out o’ th’
wagon.”</p>

<p>Phronsie looked doubtfully out of her blue
eyes—but she settled back into the good lap.</p>

<p>“Won’t he bite me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Land, no!—he hain’t got any teeth to
bite with, neither,” said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“There now,” Farmer Brown having got
down to the ground, came around to his wife’s
side of the wagon. “Come here, little gal,”
putting up his long arms.</p>

<p>Phronsie, one eye on the big dog, confidently
held out her hands, and he swung her
down, her small pink calico skirt puffing out
in her descent.</p>

<p>“He won’t hurt you, Phronsie,” cried
David, clambering over the wheel. “See,” he
patted the big dog’s head.</p>

<p>“He won’t hurt me,” repeated Phronsie,
but her little hand trembled on the shaggy
head as she said it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>“I told you so,” said Mrs. Brown, getting
heavily out of the wagon. “Now you an’
Towser is a-goin’ to be reel comf’table together.”
She glanced at Mother Pepper
standing quite still, drinking in the sweet air
in long deep breaths as she gazed about her,
and the farmer’s wife smiled. “I’m reel
pleased you like it,” she said, quite gratified.
“Well, come in an’ take your bunnit off, Mis
Pepper,” she cried hospitably, as she ducked
under the honeysuckle branches that drooped
over the doorway.</p>

<p>But Mother Pepper stood quite still.</p>

<p>“Can’t you let her be, Ma,” said the farmer,
stopping at the door-stone on his way to the
barn to untackle Jingo; “when a person’s
comf’table, let ’em stay so, I say.”</p>

<p>“I know how to take care o’ my comp’ny,”
said his wife, “you look out for the boy, an’
I’ll see to Mis Pepper and th’ little gal.”
Then to her great delight, Mother Pepper
turned and came up to the big porch.</p>

<p>“Now you lay off your things in here,”
said Mrs. Brown, leading the way to the big
bedroom in the ell. The chintz curtains
swung in the breeze that carried a pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
fragrance from the sweet-brier climbing over
the windows. “Lay your bunnit an’ shawl
right on th’ bed, Mis Pepper,” patting the
pieced bedquilt of a gorgeous “rising sun”
pattern. “An’, little girl, I’ll take off your
things for you,” turning to Phronsie, who was
holding her mother’s gown.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” said Phronsie decidedly, “I
want my Mamsie to take off my things.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown’s mouth dropped suddenly at
the corners, and over her large face spread
disappointment of the worst sort.</p>

<p>“I would let Mrs. Brown take off my
things, Phronsie,” said Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>Phronsie turned her blue eyes wonderingly
up to her mother, and seeing that she really
meant it, she dropped her hold on the protecting
gown and put up her little face for the pink
sunbonnet to be untied by the farmer’s wife.</p>

<p>“Now that is the best child that ever lived,”
exclaimed Mrs. Brown joyfully. She got
down to her fat knees, and began to fumble
with the pink calico strings. “It’s jest like
havin’ a little girl of my own,” she said, catching
her breath.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any little girl?” asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
Phronsie, patiently waiting till the strings that
now got themselves into a knot under the nervous
fingers, could be untied.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Brown, and despite all her
efforts, the big tears would come, and down
they rolled over the large face.</p>

<p>“Are you crying because you haven’t any
little girl?” Phronsie gazed in dismay at the
tears, while the large hands fumbled at their
task.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown tried to speak, but it was no
use. Down fell the pink calico strings, and
she put her hands over her face and sobbed.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry,” begged Phronsie, dreadfully
distressed.</p>

<p>“If you’d be my little girl,” said the farmer’s
wife, “p’raps—”</p>

<p>Phronsie scuttled over to Mother Pepper on
frightened little feet, the pink sunbonnet flying
off to the floor.</p>

<p>“I mean jest for to-day,” cried the farmer’s
wife after her, scared out of her tears, and
wiping them off.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper laid her hand soothingly on
the yellow hair. “She wants you to let her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
do things for you, Phronsie—just as if you
were her own little girl.”</p>

<p>“And can I go back to the little brown
house?” asked Phronsie, clutching fast her
mother’s gown, and casting fearful glances at
the big woman who had forgotten to get up
from her knees.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, you can go back with me and
with Davie,” Mamsie smiled reassuringly.</p>

<p>“Then you may do things for me,” said
Phronsie, going back to the big woman.</p>

<p>“You sweet lamb, you!” cried the farmer’s
wife, quite overcome. And she unbuttoned
the little calico sack, and getting up, she laid
it neatly on the bed by the side of Mrs. Pepper’s
bonnet and shawl.</p>

<p>“I’ve baked a little pie for you,” she leaned
over and whispered, when that was done, taking
Phronsie’s hand as she did so. “Come,
and I’ll show it to you.”</p>

<p>“For me?” cried Phronsie, showing her
little white teeth in her delight.</p>

<p>“Sure, all for you. And I curlicued th’
edge, all round.”</p>

<p>Phronsie gave a little gurgle at that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
although she didn’t know in the least what
“curlicued” meant. It must be something to
make her little pie very splendid. And she
gave a sigh of great satisfaction, and smoothed
down her pink calico gown.</p>

<p>“An’ then, says I, you shall see th’ chickies.”
By this time Mrs. Brown, holding Phronsie’s
hand, was well on the way to the big kitchen
where certain smells proclaimed very unusual
things going on in preparation for the company
dinner, Mrs. Pepper following, a happy
smile lighting her face.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Davie, lost to everything but the
bliss of being allowed to help take off Jingo’s
heavy harness, was on his tiptoes and working
with all his might to do as much with the
buckles and straps as the farmer on the other
side of the old white horse.</p>

<p>“I declare ef you ain’t as smart as th’ next
one,” declared Mr. Brown admiringly over
Jingo’s back. “You’ve helped me a whole
lot.”</p>

<p>“Have I?” cried Davie in delight. The
streams of perspiration were running down his
hot little face, and his fingers trembled over
their struggles with a refractory strap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>“I should jest say you have!” cried the
farmer. “Well now,” and he slouched
around Jingo. “There, that’s an’ awful
plaguy strap—it bothers me somethin’ dretful.”</p>

<p>“Does it?” cried Davie, quite pleased to
find that the big man didn’t blame him for his
failure to undo it.</p>

<p>“You better believe it does,” declared Mr.
Brown, laying hold of the strap; “there, you
set down on that box a spell.”</p>

<p>Davie, wanting dreadfully to ask, “Can’t I
help some more?” did as he was bidden, and
silently watched the farmer get Jingo out of
the harness and into his halter.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to lead him into th’
stall?” asked Mr. Brown, when that was all
done, and turning suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, can I—can I?” cried Davie, springing
from the box, his little hot face beaming
with delight.</p>

<p>“There ain’t nothin’ to hinder you,” said
the farmer, with a chuckle. “There now,”
and he put the halter strap into David’s hand.
“Come this way,” he was going to say, “Little
boy,” but coughed and gave it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>“You’re handy as you can be,” said Mr.
Brown, when Jingo was munching his oats.
“Now says I, let’s go down an’ see th’ pigs,”
and he put out his big hand.</p>

<p>“Phronsie loves pigs,” began Davie. Then
the color ran over his face—Mamsie had told
them not to show that they wanted anything
while on this visit. In his anxiety that
Phronsie should see the pigs, he had forgotten
that.</p>

<p>“You needn’t to worry about th’ little gal,”
said the farmer composedly, “Miss Brown’ll
look out for her.”</p>

<p>“Will she let her see the pigs?” asked
Davie, turning an anxious face up to the keen
eyes under their shaggy brows.</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Mr. Brown. “There won’t
be nothin’ that little gal ought to see, but what
she’ll see it to-day. Ma’ll look out for that,”
and he gathered up David’s little hand in his
big one.</p>

<p>David trotted along in great contentment,
trying to keep step with the farmer’s big
strides as they left the sweet-smelling old barn,
fragrant with its generous hay-lofts.</p>

<p>“You see Mis Brown has got th’ little gal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
an’ I’ve got you,” said the farmer, in great
satisfaction. “You’re my boy.”</p>

<p>Everything swam around before David’s
eyes. He stopped in silent terror, dragging
on the big hand, and his cheeks grew quite
white.</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Mr. Brown, aghast
at the storm he had raised, “wouldn’t you like
to be my boy, pray tell?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no,” cried Davie, finding his
tongue, “I’m Mamsie’s boy—I must go to
Mamsie.” But all his pulling wouldn’t get
his hand free.</p>

<p>“You see this place,” Mr. Brown went on
as fast as he could talk, and he swept his other
big hand around, “there’s everythin’ here,—and
I’d get you a pony, all for yourself, just
think, David, an’ a calf, you may have the pick
of all the bossies, an’ a pig—two of ’em, if
you want ’em.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried Davie, quite gone in his
fright that he was never going to see the little
brown house again. “Do let me go—oh,
do let me go, please!”</p>

<p>The farmer gave a long sigh. He still
clutched the small hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>“Davie,” he said, and his voice broke, “I
hain’t never had a little boy, not a single one,”
he added mournfully.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you <i>ever</i> had one?” gasped
Davie.</p>

<p>“Never!” declared Mr. Brown. His face
twitched, and if ever a big man did cry, he
looked as if he were going to that very
minute.</p>

<p>At seeing that, Davie began to lose his fright
in his distress over the farmer.</p>

<p>“Seem’s as ef you could now—” began
Mr. Brown. “<i>Hem!</i>” he brought up suddenly
at sight of the little face. “Well, we can
pretend you’re my boy jest while you’re here
to-day,” he begged.</p>

<p>“I’m Mamsie’s boy,” said Davie stoutly.</p>

<p>“I know—I know,” said the farmer reassuringly,
“but jest while you’re a-visitin’ me
to-day, you can make b’lieve you live here on
the farm.”</p>

<p>“I’m going home when Mamsie goes, and
Phronsie,” said Davie.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mr. Brown, slapping his
big hands together. “Well now, you an’
me’ll keep together, Davie, to-day. Mis’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
Brown’s got th’ little gal, an’ I’ve got you.
Come on, they’re hayin’ down in the medder,
an’ you can ride on th’ cart ef you want to.”</p>

<p>Davie slipped his hand into the big one
extended, and snuggled up to the farmer.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you haven’t ever had any little
boy,” he said, a worried look spreading all
over his round face.</p>

<p>“Don’t you let that make you feel bad,”
said Mr. Brown, trying to smile. “<i>Hem!</i>
We’ll have to hurry ef we git on to that cart
before it leaves for th’ barn! Now says I,
your little legs has got to run to keep up with
me.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>THE BEAUTIFUL DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“HEY there—look out for that boy!”
roared the farmer.</p>

<p>It was all done in a minute. The mass of
hay, with David in its center, slid neatly off
the top of the cart to the ground. Bill, the
hired man, pitchfork in hand, leaned over the
edge in a state of great consternation, the rest
of the laborers, the loading all completed,
watching to see the cart start off for the barn.</p>

<p>“Jehoshaphat!” Mr. Brown pushed them
all aside, and threw himself over the landslide
of hay. “Get him out! Get th’ boy out!”
he roared, pawing frantically to right and to
left to reach David. The laborers fell to
with such energy that hay flew in every direction,
and at last David was pulled out white as
a sheet, and gasping for breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>“Land o’ Goshen!” Farmer Brown rose
up tall and straight. “You dumb lummux,
you!” and he shook his fist at Bill, “to let this
happen!”</p>

<p>Bill cowered down on top of the hay out of
sight. David tried his best to speak, but he
hadn’t any breath to start the words.</p>

<p>“Ye ain’t hurt, be ye?” cried Farmer
Brown, in an anguish. Then he felt David’s
arms and made him take a step or two to try
his legs.</p>

<p>Davie shook his head, and said, “No,”—while
the men picked out the wisps of hay
from his soft light hair, and dusted off his
little calico blouse.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a mercy,” breathed the farmer
at last. “It’s th’ biggest luck I ever see in
my life.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t make me fall,” said Davie,
drawing the first long breath since the tumble,
and pointing up where Bill’s head showed on
the top of the load of hay, “I did it myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind—you ain’t none th’
worse for it, I reckon. But you scaret me most
out o’ my boots, Davie.” The farmer’s big
black eyes began to settle back into their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
natural places. “Well, pitch back this hay,
boys, and drive off.”</p>

<p>“Put me up,” cried Davie. “Oh, I want
to get up there again. Do, Mr. Brown,” he
begged.</p>

<p>“You sure you can stick on, Davie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will—I will stick on,” promised
Davie, dreadfully excited, “if you’ll only let
me get up there.”</p>

<p>“All right. H’ist him up, boys.”</p>

<p>So the hired men, two of them, seized David
and swung him up to the shoulders of the
third, and in “a shake of a lamb’s tail,” as
the farmer said, there he was on the top of
the load, and laughing with glee, and the men
below were pitching up the hay that had taken
a slide carrying him along with it.</p>

<p>“Keep away from th’ edge,” shouted the
farmer after him, as the big horses began to
pull the load off across the meadow.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t stand up when we get to th’
barn,” said Bill, not intending to take any risk
with this visitor to the farm. “You’ve got
to set, an’ duck your head, when Job drives
in.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lie down,” said Davie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>“That’s a good idee,” said Bill approvingly.
“Well, how’d you feel when you was a-goin’
off th’ load ker-slap?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t feel,” said Davie, “I just slid.”</p>

<p>“Warn’t you scared none?”</p>

<p>David longed to say, “No.” Instead, he
hung his head, “Yes, I was,” he said.</p>

<p>“So sh’d I have ben,” said Bill, picking up
a wisp of hay to chew it.</p>

<p>“Would you?” cried Davie eagerly, and
lifting his head suddenly, while his blue eyes
shone.</p>

<p>“Sure,” declared Bill, chewing his wisp.
“I don’t like no sech sudden removals.
’Tain’t my style.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so very glad that you’d have been
scared,” said Davie, clasping his hands.</p>

<p>“Well, you better set, or you’ll go again,”
said Bill, as the big wagon toiled over a lump,
and then swayed on to level ground once more.</p>

<p>“I’m not going again!” said David, all in
a glow to think that the big man would have
been scared, just the same as a little boy. And
he settled himself comfortably in a hollow in
the middle of the hay load.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re goin’ to stay here a spell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
ain’t you?” asked Bill, regarding the small
figure curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” declared Davie in terror. All
his glow was gone, and he looked so very miserable
that Bill hastened to reassure him.</p>

<p>“We get awful good things to eat. Ever
seen any o’ Mis Brown’s pies?” And he
smacked his lips.</p>

<p>But David’s thoughts were away off from
Mrs. Brown’s pies, or any other pies, and he
shook all over and folded his hands tightly
together.</p>

<p>“He’d set by you,” Bill pointed with his big
thumb to Farmer Brown and the hired men
following to help unload the hay, “he said you
was a-comin’ an’ he meant to keep you.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stay—I can’t!” exclaimed Davie
wildly, and springing up, he stood as straight
as he could for the jolting cart.</p>

<p>“Take care!” Bill put out a big hand and
grasped the little calico sleeve. “You better
set,” and he put him back in the hollow of the
hay. “Thunder! You needn’t feel so bad
about stayin’ here,” he added in a dudgeon,
“it’s a bang-up good farm,—’tain’t every boy
would get a chance at it, I can tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>But Davie shivered, and didn’t half hear
while Bill rattled on about Mr. Brown, and
Tom, Dick and Harry, Mr. Brown’s hired
men, and how they all hoped to spend their
days there. At last he got talked out, and
stopped and looked at David.</p>

<p>“Say, youngster, where’d you come from,
anyway?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The little brown house,” said David
faintly, without looking up.</p>

<p>“Gosh!—I thought you’d say a palace, to
the very least,” said Bill, “after turning up
your nose at this place.”</p>

<p>David unfolded his hands, and put one up
to feel of his nose. It never had been turned
up at the end, and he was relieved to find it
still the same.</p>

<p>Bill burst into such a guffaw that two old
crows flying over the field, stopped their own
hoarse croakings to listen in amazement.</p>

<p>“Got any more like you over there to the
little brown house?” asked Bill, when he came
out of his amusement. “Say, boy, I’d give
a dollar ef you would stay here.”</p>

<p>This made David’s distress very dreadful.</p>

<p>“You can cry, ef you want to, though ’tain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
very polite, after an invitation like you’ve
got,” said Bill, “an’ not set there tying your
face into knots. You ain’t a-goin’ to be kep
here agin your will. Don’t get scared, youngster.”</p>

<p>“Won’t <i>you</i> keep me?” breathed David in
a shaking voice.</p>

<p>“Me? My land o’ Goshen, I sh’d say not,”
declared Bill, slapping his overalls with a red
hand. “What do I want with a boy, pray
tell?”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” exclaimed Davie in delight,
“that you don’t want a boy, Mr. Bill,” and
his face shone, as the cart rolled up to the barn
door. David flung himself flat on his face,
just in time before they bumped over the sill.</p>

<p>As “Mr. Bill” didn’t want a boy under any
consideration, David reached the hay-loft in
a comfortable condition, and by the time that
Farmer Brown and Tom, Dick, and Harry
came up, he was shouting and laughing at a
great rate as he helped to pack the sweet-smelling
hay on the big loft.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Phronsie was having her visit
with good Mrs. Brown. Mother Pepper, seeing
how things were, had begged to be left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
in the big old kitchen to see to the dinner.
There were a pair of ducks roasting away in
the oven, and a big chicken pie, for the farmer’s
wife was determined to do things up well,
and there were potatoes and onions boiling
away, with cranberry sauce and ever so many
pies in the cupboard waiting their turn to be
invited to the table. And Mrs. Pepper, with
one of Mrs. Brown’s checked aprons tied over
her neat calico gown, moving about, in all the
mysteries of “seeing to dinner,” had such a
happy smile on her face that the big kitchen,
although it was just as different as a kitchen
could be from the little-brown-house one, began
to seem cheery and home-y at once.</p>

<p>“Phronsie,” said the farmer’s wife, “I tell
you what let’s you an’ me do—we’ll go an’
see th’ chickens first—an’ get them off’n our
minds.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go and see the chickies,” hummed
Phronsie, and putting up her small hand for
the farmer’s wife to take it, which so pleased
Mrs. Brown that her head went quite high in
the air as she picked up her black alpaca gown
and stepped off.</p>

<p>“I see them,” cried Phronsie, on a high key,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
and she tried gently to pull Mrs. Brown along
faster as they neared the chicken yard.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, child,” said Mrs. Brown, who
wasn’t accustomed to much walking out of
doors, “you don’t need to hurry so.”</p>

<p>“They’re going off,” said Phronsie in a
worried way.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they ain’t. Hens always has to
be steppin’ round important. They ain’t doin’
nothin’, only they like to be on the move all
the while.”</p>

<p>“Will they wait for us?” asked Phronsie,
anxiously watching the incessant movement in
the chicken yard.</p>

<p>“My soul an’ body!” exclaimed Mrs.
Brown, with a little laugh, “you’ll find ’em
fast enough when we get there.” But she
redoubled her pace, lumbering on till she was
quite red in the face.</p>

<p>“Can we go in?” cried Phronsie, very much
excited, as a whole bunch of fluffy little yellow
chicks tumbled over each other to get away
from the noise of their footsteps.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what we’ve come for,” said
the farmer’s wife, pushing up the hasp of the
big gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>“We’re going in!” cried Phronsie, clapping
her hands and hopping up and down. This
made the little fluffy chicks tumble over each
other worse than ever, till they looked just like
one big yellow ball.</p>

<p>“Can I take one—can I?” begged
Phronsie, running after the big ball as Mrs.
Brown pulled to the gate.</p>

<p>“You wait, little girl,” said the farmer’s
wife, “an’ by’n’by, you’ll have your lap full.”</p>

<p>Phronsie stopped and regarded her pink
calico gown. To have her lap full of chickens
was something that had to be thought out
carefully. And she was standing there quite
still when Mrs. Brown, who had hurried into
the shed, came out with a tin pan in her hand.</p>

<p>“There now, says I,” she took Phronsie’s
hand. “You come along of me,” and she led
her to the other end of the long chicken yard.
“Now we can set, an’ I’m sure I’m glad to,”
and down she went heavily on a low bench
under some currant-bushes.</p>

<p>“Chick—chick,” called the farmer’s wife.
“Set down, Phronsie. There, don’t you see
’em runnin’ fit to break their necks,” as she
put her hand in the tin pan and brought it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
forth full of corn and fine grain to fling it far
and wide.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let them break their necks—please,”
begged Phronsie. She had sat down
by Mrs. Brown’s side, but now hopped to her
feet in distress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown gave a comfortable laugh.
“They hain’t got any necks hardly to break—only
a bunch o’ feathers. Set down, an’
you may fling some corn.”</p>

<p>So Phronsie, seeing that the chickens’ necks
were to be perfectly safe, sat down on the
bench and filled both small hands with the corn
and grain.</p>

<p>Chickens of all sorts and sizes came sweeping
down in flocks till the ground all around
the bench was covered, and the first thing she
knew, one or two hopped up on the end of the
bench and jumped into Phronsie’s pink calico
gown to get nearer to the old tin pan. When
the other chickens saw that, a whole fluffy
crowd followed.</p>

<p>Phronsie gave a little squeal and threw herself
over into Mrs. Brown’s arms, thereby
upsetting a couple of the more adventurous
ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>“There—there,” chuckled the farmer’s
wife, “didn’t I tell you you’d have your lap
full. Well, see here,” to the chickens, and she
pushed off the biggest ones, “’tain’t polite to
scrouge so—you’ll all get your turn. Now,
Phronsie, let that littlest one eat out o’ your
hand.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown shook some grain into the little
calico gown. A small fluffy ball plumped
right into the middle of it, holding on by its
little claws to Phronsie’s small thumb.</p>

<p>Phronsie squealed in delight. And the little
yellow chick, not caring in the least how much
any one squealed as long as there was this
sweet grain, hung on to Phronsie’s thumb and
pecked away, the farmer’s wife scaring the
other chickens off.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible for Phronsie to tear
herself away from this enchanting party in the
old chicken yard. The farmer’s wife might
talk and talk over the charms of the pigs who
were supposed to be waiting to be visited.
Phronsie had no eyes nor ears for anything but
the “chickies” and their soft little “peep—peep.”</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Brown said, “They’ll be sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
if they eat any more,” and getting up from
the bench, she went off, tin pan and all. And
Phronsie, slipping down to the ground beneath,
sat down in the by-no-means-clean spot, and
put her arms around the fluffy bunch that
swarmed into her lap.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” exclaimed Mrs. Brown, coming
back, having disposed of the tin pan. “I
don’t know what your ma’ll think! My
senses! just look at your dress, child!”</p>

<p>Phronsie huddled up two of the chickens in
the front breadth of her pink calico gown, as
Mrs. Brown got her up to her feet.</p>

<p>So they didn’t get to the pigs after all,
Phronsie having to be led back to the farm
house for the messy little back breadth of her
gown to be washed clean. And of course,
while that was being done, she must have on
a calico wrapper of Mrs. Brown’s and sit in
the rocking chair by the kitchen window. But
she didn’t care, for the farmer’s wife let her
bring in one of the little yellow fluffy chickens.</p>

<p>And then all the merry getting ready of the
big dinner was going on, and the little pink
calico gown had to have its back breadth
smooth, so Mrs. Brown set a flat-iron on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
the stove, and got out the ironing-board.</p>

<p>“It’s jest ’xactly as if I had got a little
girl,” she kept saying to herself with happy
throbs of the heart.</p>

<p>And then, Phronsie had to stumble to the
door as well as she could for Mrs. Brown’s
big wrapper catching her feet, and put the little
chicken out.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he won’t find his way home,”
she grieved.</p>

<p>“I’ll carry him back,” said Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>So Phronsie put the little yellow fluffy chick
into Mamsie’s hand, and went into the big bedroom.
And when she came back, the little
pink calico gown all clean and smooth, and
buttoned on by Mrs. Brown, why, there was
Mamsie back again, and the old clock in the
corner said as plain as a clock could say,
“Time for dinner!”</p>

<p>And then after that big splendid dinner was
over, and the ducks’ backs didn’t have any
covering on to speak of, Farmer Brown took
Davie off to see the “bossies,” and Phronsie
crooned a little song of delight—for wasn’t
she going to help Mrs. Brown and Mamsie to
wipe the dishes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>And then she never could remember what
was done next. For the first thing she knew,
somebody was saying over her head—and
that was Mrs. Brown, “It’s a pity to wake
her!” And Phronsie rolled over on Mrs.
Brown’s big bed and opened her blue eyes,
and there was Mother Pepper,—and she said,
“But we really must start for home now.”</p>

<p>And then the pink sunbonnet was tied on,
and Davie came running up, his hands full of
treasures that Farmer Brown had given him.
And there was the old wagon with the big
white horse waiting by the porch. And then
she was lifted in and put on Mrs. Brown’s lap,
a basket of goodies on the floor, and the
farmer took up the old leather reins.</p>

<p>“Let ’er go, Bill,” he said.</p>

<p>And the beautiful day was over.</p>

<small>THE UNINVITED GUEST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THEY’RE coming!” announced Joel,
with a wry face. “O dear me!”</p>

<p>“How fine!” exclaimed Polly brightly. It
was quite elegant to be waiting for company,
but it began to be a bit tiresome. Now they
had really come! “Hurry and open the door,
Joe.”</p>

<p>Joel deserted the window and the green door
being opened, in walked Peletiah.</p>

<p>“Where’s Ezekiel?” cried Joel, looking
past him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joel,” exclaimed Polly, in great distress,
for she dearly loved fine manners, “you
must shake hands.” Then she put out her
hand, and said, “I’m glad you’ve come, Peletiah.”</p>

<p>Joel stuck out his little brown hand, then
drew it back. “He won’t do it,” he said, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
Peletiah, having to think about it first, wasn’t
ready.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Polly; “isn’t Ezekiel
coming?”</p>

<p>“My mother said he would come in half
an hour,” said Peletiah, “and I’m going to
stay until five o’clock.”</p>

<p>“O dear me!” said Joel, turning off in great
disgust, “perhaps it’s half an hour now. I’m
going out to look for him,” and he danced out
to the flat door-stone.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Polly with a little
laugh and hurrying after him. “Why, it isn’t
any time yet, Joey.”</p>

<p>“Why, Polly Pepper!” declared Joel, hopping
up and down impatiently, “it’s an awful
long time, and he keeps saying things over and
over.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind,” said Polly again.
“Now, you must come in and we’ll begin to
play something.”</p>

<p>“He can’t play,” said Joel, “and he keeps
saying things over and over.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re just doing that yourself, Joel
Pepper,” Polly burst into a merry laugh.
“Now, come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>“I’m going to watch for Ezekiel,” said Joel
obstinately.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you mustn’t,” cried Polly decidedly.
“I never heard of such a way to have
company. You must come in and make him
have a good time at your party.” And she
laid hold of his sleeve.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any good time,” grumbled
Joel, stumbling along, Polly still holding his
sleeve.</p>

<p>“Well now, boys,” said Polly, shutting the
green door. “I think the first thing we’ll do,
will be to march.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be fine,” exclaimed Joel, clapping
his hands. “I’m going to lead.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you may,” said Polly. “Get the
broom, Joel.”</p>

<p>So Joel ran over and pulled the broom down
from its hook in the corner, to stick it up by
his shoulder and prance off. “Come on,” he
shouted.</p>

<p>“Come, Peletiah,” said Polly, “you must
march next.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to march,” said Peletiah, not
moving.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do,” said Polly. “You’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
come to Joel’s party, and this begins the
party.”</p>

<p>Peletiah, not being able to contradict this,
stepped slowly forward. Then he stopped.
“Folks don’t have to do everything they don’t
want to at a party,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, they do,” said Polly, bobbing her
head decidedly, “when the party is in the
little brown house. Come now, you must
get into line.”</p>

<p>So Peletiah, seeing no help for it, found
himself back of Joel marching off with his
broom, as best he could, while Polly brought
up the rear.</p>

<p>“Come on,” shouted Joel, prancing wildly
off. Then he looked around.</p>

<p>“He isn’t marching—he’s just an old mud-turtle
crawling,” he cried in disgust.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joel!” cried Polly. “Now, Peletiah,
you must go faster.”</p>

<p>“He called me a mud-turtle,” Peletiah
stopped in his tracks, his face red clear up to
his tow hair.</p>

<p>“Joel oughtn’t to have said that,” said
Polly, “but you must go faster. Don’t you
see I can’t march at all unless you do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>“I’m not going to march,” declared Peletiah,
deserting the ranks to go across the
kitchen and sit down in one of the chairs
backed up against the wall, “and he called me
a mud-turtle, and as soon as I’m rested, I’m
going home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Polly, “you couldn’t do that.
Why, you are at a party. Well now, don’t
let’s march. We’ll play something else, till
Ezekiel comes. I know,” she clapped her
hands and spun around once or twice in the
middle of the floor.</p>

<p>Joel threw down the broom wrathfully.</p>

<p>“You must hang it up first,” said Polly,
coming out of her spin.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any party,” declared Joel,
“not a single snitch of one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do,” said Polly, running up
to him. “Hang up the broom, Joel—that’s
a good boy. I’ve thought of something just
too splendid for anything.”</p>

<p>If Polly had thought of “something just too
splendid for anything,” that altered matters,
and after all, the party might be quite worth
while. So Joel ran and got the broom back
on its nail—then he was back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>“What is it—what is it?” he cried, his
black eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“He called me a mud-turtle,” said Peletiah
over in the chair backed up against the wall,
“and I’m going home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Polly ran over to stand in front
of him. “Company never goes home from a
party till it’s over. Besides, we’re going to
play perfectly splendid things, and there’s the
refreshments.”</p>

<p>“Refreshments!” howled Joel, “are there
going to be refreshments! Oh, I do want a
party, Polly, I do,” and he swarmed all over
her.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Joel,” she said in vexation. O
dear, and it was to be such a surprise, and
now she’d told before it was time!</p>

<p>“They’re in the cupboard, the refreshments
are,” said Joel, springing off to the corner.
“I know they are.”</p>

<p>“Joel, you mustn’t,” cried Polly, flying
after to stop him. But she was too late! He
flung open the door of the old cupboard, and
there on the shelf was the custard pie, and
beside it three cups and a pitcher.</p>

<p>“A pie!” screamed Joel, his nose wrinkling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
up, and he stood on his tiptoes to reach it.
“Oh, I want some now. Do let me, Polly.”</p>

<p>“For shame, Joel,” cried Polly angrily.
“Come right straight away.” She seized his
calico blouse.</p>

<p>But Joel hung with both hands to the edge
of the shelf. And the green door opening, in
came Ezekiel.</p>

<p>“There now, just see, here’s the rest of your
company coming,” cried Polly, quite lost in
her vexation. “Now I don’t believe I shall
let you have any pie at all.”</p>

<p>“It’s my party,” howled Joel, still hanging
to the shelf and looking over his shoulder at
her, “and I’m going to have the refreshments,
Polly.”</p>

<p>“How do you do, Ezekiel,” said Polly.</p>

<p>Ezekiel had on a new calico blouse, pink and
white striped, that the minister’s wife had sat
up the night before to finish for the party.
And he was hardly able to take his thoughts
from it, until he saw the pie, and underneath
it Joel hanging to the shelf. Then he stared
out of big eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have some refreshments,”
cried Joel over to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>“Oh, no,” contradicted Polly. “Joel has
been naughty,” she said to Ezekiel, “and he
ought not to have any pie.”</p>

<p>“He called me a mud-turtle,” said Peletiah,
over in the chair by the wall. He concluded
not to say anything about going home since
he heard “refreshments and pie.”</p>

<p>“O dear!” exclaimed Polly, her cheeks
very hot.</p>

<p>“Can’t I have any pie?” gasped Joel, dropping
suddenly to the floor, his face working
dreadfully as he tried not to cry.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can,” said Polly
slowly. She hated to say it, but when a boy
was naughty, why of course he ought not to
have goodies.</p>

<p>Joel threw himself flat on the floor, and
sobbed as if his heart would break.</p>

<p>“And I can’t have any, either,” Polly leaned
over him to say it, “because I got angry.”</p>

<p>This was so very dreadful that Joel raised
his head to look at her, the tears dripping off
from his round cheeks. And the old kitchen
became so very still, you could have heard a
pin drop.</p>

<p>Peletiah slipped off from his chair and came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
slowly up. “And I was naughty, too,” he
said, “’cause I was going home.”</p>

<p>“Then Ezekiel will have the whole pie,”
cried Joel, and down went his head again to
the floor, where he kicked and screamed so
that all the pins in the world dropping couldn’t
possibly have been heard.</p>

<p>Did ever anybody see such a party! Polly
clasped her hands tightly and said to herself,
“I won’t cry! Oh, if Mamsie were only
here!”</p>

<p>But it wouldn’t do any good to keep saying
that to herself. She must <i>do</i> something.
She swallowed very hard. “I’m going to play
‘Old Father Dubbin,’” she cried, and spun
out to the middle of the old kitchen floor.</p>

<p>Up came Joel’s head. “Are you really
going to play ‘Old Father Dubbin,’ Polly?”
he cried, blinking through his tears.</p>

<p>“Of course, I am,” cried Polly gayly, running
into the bedroom to kneel down before
the bottom drawer of Mamsie’s big bureau.
Here Polly kept the things for that much-prized
play of “Old Father Dubbin.”
Phronsie’s red-topped shoes were there, too,
and the other few treasures possessed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
“Five Little Peppers.” All except the fish-hooks,
and the dried bugs, and such choice possessions
that Joel and David exulted in.
Those Mother Pepper said must be kept up
in the loft.</p>

<p>Polly dragged out “Old Father Dubbin’s”
queer little hat, and the rest of his things.
Her heart beat dreadfully and one or two tears
dropped into the drawer. “I mustn’t cry—anyway,
not until the party is over,” she said,
shutting the drawer.</p>

<p>Out in the kitchen Joel was prancing about,
screaming, “We’re going to play ‘Old Father
Dubbin’—we are!” until Ezekiel ran up to
him. “I’m going to play it, too.” So Joel
seized his arms and they spun around together.</p>

<p>Peletiah fidgeted first on one foot, then on
the other. At last he said, “I will play it,
too.” And he tried to get in between the two
boys. But he was so slow, they only bumped
into him, almost knocking him over.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how,” Joel was just going
to scream at him, as they spun past him.
Then he remembered, “Well, come on,” he
said, opening his arms.</p>

<p>Before he knew it, Peletiah was being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
danced about till he thought his head would
fly off. Then he was quite sure it would. He
tried to say, “<i>Stop</i>,” but he didn’t get breath
enough.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” exclaimed “Old Father
Dubbin,” coming out of the bedroom, as they
whirled past. The minute they caught sight
of the old gentleman, Joel gave a squeal and
the dance came to such a sudden stop that
Peletiah’s feet flew out from under him and
down he sat on the floor. Ezekiel sank panting
down beside him.</p>

<p>“Well now,” “Old Father Dubbin” looked
through his big spectacles, which were nothing
but holes and a pasteboard frame tied around
his head, “you must all rest, before we begin
the play.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” roared Joel, “I’m not tired,
not a single squinchy bit.”</p>

<p>“But the company is,” said Old Father
Dubbin, resting on his staff.</p>

<p>Joel looked down impatiently on the two
boys. “You aren’t tired, are you?” he said,
“not a bit, are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m most dreadfully tired,” declared Peletiah,
taking up one foot to rub it. “And you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
stepped all over me, and wouldn’t let me stop,
either.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Joel disdainfully, turning
on his small heel. “Well, when can we begin?”
he teased, going over to Old Father
Dubbin.</p>

<p>“Just as soon as the company is rested,”
said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>“Begin with me—do begin with me,”
cried Joel, circling around him, “please, Old
Father Dubbin.”</p>

<p>Polly was just going to say, “It isn’t polite
to begin before company is ready,” and then
when she thought what a dreadful time they
had all had, she said, “All right. Now come
on.”</p>

<p>And they did come on, Old Father Dubbin
and Joel; and Ezekiel forgot how tired he was
and screamed with delight, and Peletiah let his
foot take care of itself, and pretty soon the
two boys hopped up and said they were
“plenty rested,” and then the old kitchen was
in an uproar.</p>

<p>So of course no one heard what was happening
in the bedroom.</p>

<p>There was a string of thin old gold beads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
that Mrs. Pepper kept rolled up in soft paper
in the little drawer at the top of the bureau.
They used to be worn on Father Pepper’s
grandmother’s neck, and were to be Polly’s
some time, as the one treasure that was left.
Now they were spread on the old patched bedquilt,
and somebody in a black hat pulled down
over his eyes, stopped to gaze at them.
Then he turned off to pull things over in
the bureau once more, every now and then
pausing to listen to the babel going on in the
kitchen. But as the window was open, he
didn’t care very much if the noise did stop, for
couldn’t he spring out at the least warning just
as easily as he jumped in, pray tell! So he
rummaged on.</p>

<p>At last, Old Father Dubbin held up his staff.
“All done,” he said, “the play is over.” And
Joel might tease and tease—there was to be
no more for that day. Everybody must sit
down to draw a long breath.</p>

<p>Then the person in the bedroom took his
hand out of the bureau drawer, and stepping
over to the bed he gathered up Father Pepper’s
grandmother’s gold beads, slipped them into
his pocket, and jumped out of the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>“O dear, I’m so hot!” cried Joel, seeing
that there was to be no more “Old Father
Dubbin,” no matter how he teased, “I’m going
to get Mamsie’s fan. Can’t I, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Polly. It was Joel’s party and
they’d had such a dreadful time,—and a sorry
little look came into the brown eyes,—Mamsie
surely would let him take it. So Joel dashed
into the bedroom to get the big palm-leaf fan
that was stuck into the frame of the looking
glass over the bureau.</p>

<p>Then they heard a dreadful scream that
brought Old Father Dubbin into the bedroom,
and after him the two Henderson boys.</p>

<p>There was Joel, his black eyes wide with
excitement, and swinging his arms. “A
burglar!” he shouted, “I’ll catch him,” and
he dashed to the window and jumped out.</p>

<p>Old Father Dubbin took one look all
around; then flew over to the bed. There was
the roll of soft old paper that had held Father
Pepper’s grandmother’s gold beads, but empty.
Polly dashed wildly out through the kitchen,
flung the green door wide and rushed after
Joel.</p>

<small>GREAT-GRANDMOTHER PEPPER’S
BEADS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THERE’S the little brown house!” cried
Davie, just as if he had never seen it.
“And Joel has had a party!” all in the same
breath.</p>

<p>“Joel has had a party,” hummed Phronsie
in Mrs. Brown’s lap, “a beyewtiful party,”
her pink sunbonnet flying back with the jolts
of the old white horse over the rough road.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper’s eyes grew suddenly bright.
“You have been so very good to us, dear
Mrs. Brown,” she said, leaning over to whisper
the words.</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife held Phronsie closer, but
did not trust herself to speak.</p>

<p>“At least,” she said, clearing her throat,
“you’ll come again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” Mrs. Pepper was about to
reply, but David screamed, “There’s Joel—Oh,
do let me get out!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>“Whoa!” cried the farmer, and Davie was
out, over the wheel in a twinkling, and rushing
up to Joel sitting on a big stone by the
roadside, and the very picture of woe.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joel!” cried David, flinging himself
up against him, “what’s the matter? Mamsie—he’s
sick,” flying back to the wagon and
wringing his hands.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry your ma. She’ll get out as
soon as she can,” said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper was already out at her side
of the wagon, and reaching Joel on his stone.
The happy expectant look had gone from her
eyes, but she still smiled.</p>

<p>“He’s sick, Mamsie,” cried Davie frantically,
and kneeling down to seize Joel’s
hands.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” declared Joel in a dudgeon,
“sick one single bit. I didn’t catch him and
he’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Who has gone, Joel?” Mrs. Pepper put
her hands on his two shoulders. “Look up
and tell Mother.”</p>

<p>Joel raised his black eyes and cried wrathfully,
“And he took your gold beads, Mamsie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>“Oh, Joel, not those!” For once Mother
Pepper forgot herself and her hands dropped
to her side. The little thin string of gold
beads was all she had to hand down to Polly
as a link from the past.</p>

<p>“I’ll go after him some more,” screamed
Joel wildly, and jumping from his stone.
He had an awful feeling at his heart, for
Mamsie had never given up like that before.</p>

<p>“No, no, Joel,” Mother Pepper managed a
smile, and seized his sleeve.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the farmer’s
wife, clumsily picking her way up to them
over the thick uneven grass, and still holding
Phronsie’s hand.</p>

<p>“Nothing so very bad,” said Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“Nothing so very bad!” echoed Joel, turning
big eyes up to his mother.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Pepper cheerfully, “as
long as nobody is sick. Where is Polly?”
she asked, a white line beginning to show itself
around her mouth.</p>

<p>“She’s gone after Ben, and she told me to
stay here and tell you,” said Joel gloomily,
“And I was going after the burglar some
more,” he added in an injured tone. “I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
going now.” He leaped away, and in another
second would have been around the bushes and
out of sight.</p>

<p>“Joel!” Mother Pepper’s voice was low,
but it brought him back. “I need you now.”
She took his little brown hand, “You can help
me so much.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you, Mamsie,” said Joel, feeling
very tall and important. “You don’t have
to come, Davie; Mamsie’s got me,” he said
over his shoulder, as Davie crowded up.</p>

<p>“Oh, I want Davie; we shall both need
him,” said Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“You can come,” said Joel patronizingly,
and striding off, clinging to Mrs. Pepper’s
hand.</p>

<p>Davie lifted his face that had become quite
downcast with this dreadful trouble coming
to Mamsie, and then, too, not being wanted to
help, and trotted after.</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife not having heard the
word “burglar,” grasped Phronsie’s hand
tighter yet. “Come, child,” she said, “an’
you an’ me’ll find out what’s ben goin’ on.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find out,” Phronsie cried with a little
gurgle of delight, skipping along by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
clumsy footsteps, “and I’ll show you my little
brown house.”</p>

<p>“So you shall, you sweet lamb, you,” exclaimed
Mrs. Brown, yet with a heavy heart
against the hour when she and the farmer
would be in the big wagon and on the Maybury
road, going home, just those two.</p>

<p>Once in the old kitchen, the story came out,
with many jerks from Joel, as he often
stopped to bemoan the loss of a chance to capture
the burglar, and the positive assurance
that he could have beaten him to nothing if
he had only been there.</p>

<p>“My senses!—your gold beads!” exclaimed
the farmer’s wife. She had sat down
in Mrs. Pepper’s calico-covered rocking chair,
and now she lifted both hands in dismay.
“How you can, Mis Pepper, take it so easy!”</p>

<p>“Just think, all the children are well,” said
Mrs. Pepper with a smile.</p>

<p>“I know,” said Mrs. Brown, “but gold
beads is gold beads.”</p>

<p>David, seeing Mother Pepper’s smile,
brightened up a little, as he sat on the floor at
her feet, as the story went on. Phronsie was
going about, patting everything with loving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
little fingers, and humming softly to herself,
so she didn’t hear how Joel’s party had been
interrupted by an uninvited guest in the bedroom.
And how Polly had run out in “Old
Father Dubbin’s” rig after Joel in hot chase
to catch the visitor, who had jumped out of
the window, without any one’s getting a sight
of him.</p>

<p>“And then Polly made me go and watch
for you, while she went for Ben.” All Joel’s
injured feelings now blazed out again. “And
she told me not to stir till you came, or she
got back. I could have caught him just as
easy.” Joel doubled up his little brown fists
manfully.</p>

<p>“Polly was just right,” said Mother Pepper,
“and you are a good boy, Joel. Mother
is so glad she can trust you.”</p>

<p>Joel’s indignation changed to a smile that
showed his little white teeth—just as Farmer
Brown, having tied “Jingo” to a post in the
fence, walked in. “Well, did you have a
good party, Joe?” he asked breezily, not
knowing anything about burglars or any other
trouble.</p>

<p>“And did you like th’ custard pie?” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
Mrs. Brown, gazing about for any evidences
of the feast.</p>

<p>Joel ran up to the big chair. “We haven’t
had it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you’ve had other things to think
about beside custard pie,” said the farmer’s
wife. “Well, I s’pose likely that Polly put
it away.”</p>

<p>“I know where she’s put it,” Joel pranced
over to swing the door of the old cupboard
wide open. “Here ’tis!” He stood on his
tiptoes, clinging to the upper shelf where the
big custard pie, with a pitcher of weak lemonade
and some teacups stood, ready to be summoned
when Polly should decide that the
proper time for refreshments had arrived.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get it down now!” cried Joel,
jumping up to reach it with wild little hands.</p>

<p>“No, no, Joel,” said Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>And the farmer’s wife cried, “For mercy’s
sake, Mr. Brown, lift that pie down, or that
boy will smash it.” So the big custard pie
was safely taken from the shelf and set on
the table.</p>

<p>“Dave, see—the custard pie!” screamed
Joel, waving frantically for David to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>“There’s somethin’ in th’ pitcher,” said the
farmer, handing down the lemonade. “I
guess that’s for th’ party.” So he set that on
the table, too.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Pepper. “Mr. Atkins
gave Davie a couple of lemons the other day.
And Polly has made this for Joel’s party.”</p>

<p>“I want it now—my party,” cried Joel,
and pulling out the table-drawer to get the big
knife. Then he suddenly stopped. “I’ve got
to wait for Polly,” he said.</p>

<p>“You better wait till your big brother gets
here, too,” said the farmer, pointing with a
thumb over his shoulder in the direction he
supposed Polly and Ben would appear.</p>

<p>“Yes, so I say,” cried Mrs. Brown, swaying
comfortably back and forth in the rocking chair.</p>

<p>“They’re never coming,” declared Joel, in
anguish at any proposed postponement of the
cutting of the pie. Still he must see Polly
before it was cut.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t wonder ef they was comin’
down th’ road this very minute,” said Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>“You better run an’ see,” added the farmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>So Joel tore himself away from the pie, and
dashed out and down to the gate, Davie at
his heels.</p>

<p>“Ef we can help you, Mis Pepper,” said
the farmer, “we’ll stay—but ef so be there’s
nothin’ my wife an’ me can do, why, we must
be streakin’ it for home.”</p>

<p>“We don’t need to start jest yet, Pa,” objected
his wife, all her eyes following
Phronsie.</p>

<p>“Now, Ma, you won’t be a bit spryer to go,
ef you set for another hour. I’m a-goin’ ef
we can’t help Mis Pepper.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can help her,” said Mrs.
Brown, clinging to any straw that might delay
the setting out for home.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Pepper shook her head—so far
as any assistance was concerned. “I wish
you could stay,” she said. But this Mr.
Brown wouldn’t do, so the farmer’s wife, seeing
that there was no help for it, got slowly
out of her chair, and the leave-taking began.
And just as they were finally in the big wagon,
up rushed Polly and Ben and Joel.</p>

<p>“Anybody seen th’ feller?” asked the
farmer of Ben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>“No, sir,” said Ben, setting his teeth together
hard.</p>

<p>“Sho now, that’s too bad,” said Mr. Brown
sympathetically, and flicking his whip over
Jingo’s back. “Well, I s’pose th’ Badgertown
folks’ll keep on th’ lookout for him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say any more, Pa,” said his wife
with a nudge, “for mercy’s sake!”</p>

<p>“Hem!” Mr. Brown cleared his throat,
opened his mouth; then thought better of his
determination to speak, and shut it with a
snap.</p>

<p>“Good-by.” Mrs. Brown, with no eyes for
any one but Phronsie, looked back until the
turn of the road made it impossible to see any
one, or even the little brown house.</p>

<p>“Now we must have the party and Joel’s
pie,” said Mrs. Pepper, when the disconsolate
little group was back in the kitchen. “And
you may get the knife, Joey.” But first, there
was a little talk between Polly and Joel and
Mother Pepper. When it was all over, she
said, “Yes, Polly, you and Joel may have some
of the pie, and Joel must cut it now.” And
no one peering in at the window would have
thought that the chief treasure of the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
had been seized that afternoon by a cruel hand.</p>

<p>They didn’t want any supper that night because
of the custard pie and the lemonade.
And after Phronsie was fast asleep in the
trundle-bed, and the two boys were tucked
safely away in the loft, Polly and Ben curled
up on the floor, either side of her big chair.</p>

<p>“I can’t think, Mamsie,” began Ben, “who
it could be.” He wrinkled up his round face
in distress.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Pepper, “we can’t think.
But oh, Polly child.” She put her hand on
Polly’s brown hair and her voice trembled.</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” cried Polly, “don’t feel badly.
I don’t mind—so very much.” She longed
to put her head on her mother’s lap and cry,
for she felt no bigger than Phronsie. Oh,
the years that she had loved those beads, ever
since she was a little girl and Mrs. Pepper had
taken them out and told her that she was to
have them when she was grown up, and then
every time that this was done, and before the
beads were wrapped up in the soft paper and
put back in the drawer, the words of the
father, who had died when Phronsie was a
baby, would be said over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>“Always remember, child,” Mrs. Pepper
would say, “what your father told you.
‘You must be good, Polly, to be worthy to
wear Grandma’s beads.’”</p>

<p>And Polly had always said, “I will.” And
now the beads were gone—oh, could she bear
it!</p>

<p>But she looked at Mother Pepper’s face,
and what father had said meant, she very well
knew, “help Mother,” so she swallowed the
sobs that were almost out. And Ben, as he
looked at her, set his teeth and concluded to
do the same thing.</p>

<p>“Tell us about Mr. Brown’s farm,” said
Ben, as soon as he could speak. “We want to
hear about it, Mamsie.”</p>

<p>So Mrs. Pepper began, and set the whole
day before them from beginning to end.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad,” said Polly, with a long
breath, “that Davie had a good time—because
he didn’t want to go without Joel.”</p>

<p>“Joel is going to have a chance,” said
Mother Pepper, “and you, Ben, and you, too,
Polly, for we’re all invited to spend a day there
before very long.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that fine!” cried Polly, forgetting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
for a moment her dreadful trouble, and she
clapped her hands. And Ben was so pleased
at that, that he actually smiled.</p>

<p>“And now you must get to bed, both of
you.” Mother Pepper looked up at the old
clock on the shelf. “Dear me, who would
think it was so late!”</p>

<p>It was all of an hour after, and Mrs. Pepper,
who had been sewing by the light of the
candle, to make up for the time spent in the
visit of that day, let the work drop in her lap,
and she was lost in thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly a noise like a little mouse at work
in the corner, struck upon her ear, to be followed
by another not at all like one to be laid
to a mouse, and then a distinct, though soft,
rap was heard.</p>

<p>She got out of her chair, and went over to
the big green door and opened it.</p>

<p>“Why, Jimmy!” she exclaimed, “is your
mother sick?”</p>

<p>An awkward, overgrown boy leaned against
the door-casing, and covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” commanded Mrs. Pepper,
“or I can’t help you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>The boy caught his breath, then gasped,
“’Tain’t that—Mother’s all right.”</p>

<p>“Then it is something about yourself,” said
Mrs. Pepper kindly. “Now, Jimmy, you
want me to help you, or you wouldn’t have
come at this time of the night.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been walking up and down,” said
Jimmy. “First, I waited till they were all
abed, ’xcept you, and—” then he broke down.</p>

<p>“Well, now that you have come, you must
tell me your trouble, or I can’t help you,” said
Mrs. Pepper decidedly.</p>

<p>For answer, he ran his hand in the pocket of
his shabby jacket, and pulling out something,
timidly presented it—and Mrs. Pepper’s fingers
were over Polly’s gold beads that Great-Grandmother
Pepper had left her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jimmy!” all the gladness over their
coming back couldn’t stop the pain, “how
could you!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he gasped, and he looked
so distressed that Mrs. Pepper hastened to say,
“You didn’t think, Jimmy, you didn’t,
how—”—“wicked,” she was going to say,
when he burst out, “Yes, I did—I saw you
through the window take ’em out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
bureau one time, and roll ’em up again and
put ’em back. And I—I—wanted to go to
the circus—it’s coming to Cherryville next
week, and—and—”</p>

<p>It was no use, he couldn’t go on with Mrs.
Pepper’s black eyes on him, but cowered worse
yet against the door-casing.</p>

<p>“But you’ve brought them back,” at last
Mrs. Pepper made herself say, “that was good
of you, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“I—I couldn’t keep ’em. You’ve been
awful nice to Mother. Don’t tell her,” he
brought himself up in sudden terror. “You
won’t—oh, you won’t, Mrs. Pepper!” he
begged, shaking all over.</p>

<p>“I won’t, Jimmy,” promised Mrs. Pepper.
“Now see here, my boy, you’re almost a man—and
I’m going to see you make a man that
we all in Badgertown will be proud of.” She
put her hand on his shoulder. “Now run
home and hop into bed.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>JIMMY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a sound of somebody hurrying
along the road back of her, who
wasn’t accustomed to running, and who
couldn’t walk fast. And then that somebody
gasped, “Mrs. Pepper!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper turned, “Why, Mary Pote!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mary Pote, bringing her short
roly-poly figure to a standstill and putting her
hand to her side, “I’m mortal glad you
stopped, for I couldn’t have held out much
more. I’ve been chasin’ you clear from Atkins’s
store.” She brought this all out in
gasps.</p>

<p>“Now that’s too bad,” exclaimed Mrs. Pepper
sympathetically.</p>

<p>“You see— My! but I’m hot.” Mary
Pote twitched off her leghorn hat, and began
to fan herself furiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>Mrs. Pepper looked about. “There’s a big
stone,” she said, “let us sit down.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m glad to,” said Mary Pote,
going off to the roadside after her, and sinking
down under an old scrub oak, over which
blackberry vines scrambled at their own sweet
will. Mrs. Pepper sat down on the other end
of the stone, and placed the bundle of coats
Mr. Atkins had given her, on the grass at her
feet.</p>

<p>“When I get my breath enough, I’ll tell
you,” said Mary Pote, “what I was following
you for.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper folded her hands in her lap,
and let her gaze wander off to the hills encircling
Badgertown. It was hard to remember
when she had done a thing like this, idling
of a morning on a roadside stone.</p>

<p>“Well now,” said Mary Pote, “I’m getting
my second wind and I’ll begin. Miss Parrott
sent me down to say that she wanted to have
you and the children go to the circus to-morrow
at Cherryville.”</p>

<p>“<i>To the circus!</i>” Mrs. Pepper hastily
turned her gaze from the hills and turned to
Mary Pote in blank amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>“To the circus, I said,” Mary Pote nodded
and picked off a spear of grass to break into
small bits and scatter in her lap, “though if
all is told, I b’lieve it’s a sight more of a
menagerie than any other show. Anyway,
Miss Parrott told me to tell you that she was
going to send you all to it, if you’d go.”</p>

<p>“Not all of us?” said Mrs. Pepper incredulously.</p>

<p>“Every single one of you. I’ll give you
her very words,—‘Mary Pote, you go down
and say to Mrs. Pepper that I want her and
all the children to go to the circus to-morrow.
Mind, Mary Pote, Mrs. Pepper and every one
of the Five Little Peppers.’ There you have
it.” She picked off a second spear of grass
and sent the bits after the others.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper drew a long breath. “Oh, I
don’t think I can,” she said.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t think, if I was you,” said Mary
Pote, “I never do when Miss Parrott says a
thing, but I just get up and do it.”</p>

<p>“It’s so good of her,” began Mrs. Pepper.
Oh, to have Polly see the animals that she was
always making up into stories to keep the children
quiet, and Phronsie—only think of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
delight over the monkeys. And there was
Joel—well, Mrs. Pepper by this time was so
excited that she turned a face on which two
red spots were coming in her cheeks. Mary
Pote had the good sense to let the thing work
itself out, and kept quiet.</p>

<p>And Davie, could Mother Pepper ever forget
his face when the circus came to Cherryville
last, and almost all Badgertown folks
went over but the little-brown-house people?
And Davie, his eyes on her, had tried to smile
when Joel howled in his distress at missing it.
And there was good, faithful Ben, who
wouldn’t even show that above all things he
had longed to see a circus.</p>

<p>“I would like to have the children see it,”
she said slowly—her eyes alight.</p>

<p>“Well, if I was you—I wouldn’t sit on
that stone considering it any longer,” said
Mary Pote. “Miss Parrott is one to speak
her mind, and if she asks you, you might take
it for granted that she wants you. Well, I
must get back—she took me off from that
black silk basque I was finishing, to come
down. Simmons is going to pick me up at
Mr. Beebe’s shoe-shop, so I must get there as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
soon as I can.” Mary Pote rose from her end
of the big stone and shook her front breadth
free of the grass bits. “Well, is it yes or
no?” she said.</p>

<p>“It is yes,” said Mrs. Pepper, her voice
trembling with happiness, “and oh, Mary
Pote, will you tell her how I thank her. She
is <i>so good</i> to ask us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her.” Mary Pote pushed back her
little corkscrew curls on either side of her
round face and clapped on her leghorn hat.</p>

<p>“Oh,” turning back, “she said, ‘tell Mrs.
Pepper to be ready at eleven o’clock.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Pepper, scarcely realizing
the bliss that was actually in her grasp.</p>

<p>“And one thing more,” Mary Pote looked
over her shoulder. “She said you’d find the
lunch-basket in the carriage.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper tried to say something; but
Mary Pote was moving off intent on reaching
old Mr. Beebe’s shoe-shop, for Simmons didn’t
like to wait for any one sent on errands, and
he could make it very unpleasant for days if
thus detained.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Pepper started, took a step
forward—then another and faster, all her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
effort being to overtake the little roly-poly
figure hurrying over the dusty road.</p>

<p>“Mary—<i>Mary Pote!</i>” Her voice was so
clear that it carried well, and her steps so rapid
that she soon stood beside the little woman.</p>

<p>“Now you aren’t going to say ‘No.’” Mary
Pote regarded her with disfavor.</p>

<p>“I’ve come for something else—to ask you
to beg a favor of Miss Parrott.” The color
flew suddenly out of Mrs. Pepper’s cheek, but
she went on bravely. Mary Pote stared with
all her eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s this,” Mrs. Pepper went on rapidly.
It was best to get it out as soon as possible.
“To beg her to let me take another boy with
my children.”</p>

<p>“What boy?” asked Mary Pote abruptly.</p>

<p>“Jimmy Skinner.”</p>

<p>“What—that woman that lives on
Fletcher Road—her boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“He’s an idle, good-for-nothing boy,” declared
Mary Pote, shaking her head decidedly
till the corkscrew curls flew out. “No, I
don’t b’lieve Miss Parrott would ever countenance
his going in all this world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>“His mother works so hard—it would
please her,” began Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“That’s true enough, but the boy, no, he
ain’t worth doing things for. I shouldn’t
think you’d want him along with your children,
Mrs. Pepper.” She regarded her curiously.</p>

<p>“Jimmy thinks a great deal of his mother,”
said Mrs. Pepper. She fastened her black
eyes on the little woman’s face. “That’s
enough to save any boy. Won’t you ask Miss
Parrott to let him go?”</p>

<p>“What? Me ask her? Oh, I couldn’t.”
Mary Pote started back and put up both hands.
“I’ll do anything to oblige you, Mrs. Pepper,
but I couldn’t do that. Besides, she’d only
say ‘No.’”</p>

<p>“Well, good-by,” said Mrs. Pepper. She
turned and went rapidly back to the big stone,
picked up her bundle, and sped home.</p>

<p>Polly ran out to meet her, and take the
bundle of coats. “I’m going on an errand,
child,” said her mother, “and I may be home
a little late, so don’t worry.”</p>

<p>Polly’s brown eyes looked questions, but
Mrs. Pepper only smiled, as she turned off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>She didn’t give herself much time to reflect
all the way to the Parrott estate. And at last
Hooper was ushering her into the solemn
drawing-room with its rich furniture and
heavy brocaded hangings, and presently Miss
Parrott was before her,—and the thing was
to be done.</p>

<p>“Now, Mrs. Pepper, do take off your bonnet,
you look so tired, and I will give you some
tea.” And Miss Parrott’s heavy black silk
gown was trailing across the room to the bell-cord.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, please,” Mrs. Pepper put up a protesting
hand. “I must speak to you—please,
Miss Parrott.”</p>

<p>It was so pleading a tone, very like Polly’s,
that Miss Parrott turned back and sat down
in the high-backed chair, regarding her visitor
curiously.</p>

<p>“You are so good to me and to my children
that I cannot thank you enough, Miss Parrott,”
began Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“There—there,” returned Miss Parrott,
raising a protesting hand, only it sparkled
with ancestral rings. “Mary Pote brought
back your thanks, so say no more about that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>“Miss Parrott.” Mrs. Pepper hesitated a
bit, then took the plunge, “I very much wish
that a boy might go to the circus with me and
my children.” It was all done in one sentence.</p>

<p>“A boy?” Miss Parrott gazed at her. It
seemed like a long time, but it was really only
a breathing space. “What boy, Mrs. Pepper?”</p>

<p>“Jimmy Skinner.”</p>

<p>Miss Parrott’s long face dropped. If Mary
Pote had been there, she could tell the “signs
of the times” it gave. Mrs. Pepper could
guess, but her black eyes did not droop, and
now she went on steadily.</p>

<p>“His mother lives on Fletcher Road, a
hard-working woman, glad to do anything.”</p>

<p>Miss Parrott’s brow wrinkled. “Go on,”
she said, “if you please, Mrs. Pepper.”</p>

<p>“And Jimmy thinks a great deal of his
mother,” Mrs. Pepper considering it wise to
bring this point to the front as speedily as possible,
went on pleadingly.</p>

<p>“If I remember rightly,” said Miss Parrott
drily, “that Jimmy is considered by the
village people to be an idle, good-for-nothing
boy, Mrs. Pepper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>“Yes, he’s idle,” confessed Mrs. Pepper,
“but I believe he will work, for he thinks so
much of his mother.”</p>

<p>“And you want him to go to the circus with
<i>your</i> children, and in <i>my</i> carriage!”</p>

<p>It was perfectly dreadful the silence that
followed. At last Mrs. Pepper said in a low
but distinct voice, “Yes, Miss Parrott.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry—but I am obliged to say I
consider it unwise to draw that boy into the
company.” Miss Parrott drew herself up
stiffly against the high-backed chair, till she
looked exactly like the portrait in the wide
hall, the most disagreeable of all the ancestors
whom she possessed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper opened her lips, thought better
of it, and closed them. Then she got off from
her chair.</p>

<p>“Do sit down,” Miss Parrott waved her
long fingers. “I want to oblige you, Mrs.
Pepper,” she said, struggling to throw a little
cordiality into her manner and tone, “but I
cannot see my way clear to grant this request.”</p>

<p>Again there was silence, cold and dreadful;
then Mrs. Pepper moved toward the door.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
Miss Parrott got out of her chair, “Don’t
go.” She took a step or two, astonished at herself.
When had she ever capitulated to any one,
and here was a plain woman from a little
brown house making her experience such a
strange desire to yield to the distasteful request!</p>

<p>“I really wish you would tell me,” she laid
the long fingers on Mrs. Pepper’s shawl, “all
about it—why you wish that boy to be drawn
in to the company, with your children. It
is most astonishing. I cannot understand
it.”</p>

<p>So Mrs. Pepper suffered herself to be led,
and she presently found herself sitting, this
time on the brocaded sofa, and Miss Parrott
by her side.</p>

<p>“Jimmy is going to be a man,” she said,
just as she had told the boy, only she never
whispered a word of his wrong-doing, “if
Badgertown people take hold and help.”</p>

<p>“And would it help to take him to the
circus?”</p>

<p>“I think it would be the greatest help in all
this world.” Mrs. Pepper leaned forward, her
eyes sparkled, and she was as eager as Polly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
now. “Don’t you see, he longs to go?
Every boy does. And if he can be invited by
you, Miss Parrott—”</p>

<p>“And go with you, and the Five Little Peppers,”
interrupted Miss Parrott. “Yes, I begin
to see.”</p>

<p>“And once he thinks that he’s a boy that
people believe has got something worth while
in him, why, he’ll see it himself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Miss Parrott, finding herself
thawing all over.</p>

<p>“And then when he sees that, he’ll take hold
and work—if it is found for him.” Here
Mrs. Pepper went more slowly and looked
fixedly into the long face.</p>

<p>“You mean that perhaps I might find some
work for him,” said Miss Parrott. “Well,
perhaps so, but I haven’t got that boy to the
circus yet. Let us settle that matter first,”
and a grim smile stole over her long face.
“Now proceed, please, Mrs. Pepper.”</p>

<p>“And a boy who has something worth while
in him, can’t help but grow up to be a man,” Mrs.
Pepper said with emphasis, “a <i>real</i> man, can
he, Miss Parrott?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” said Miss Parrott, a bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
grudgingly, as all her defenses were thrown
down. Then she smiled, “Oh, you may take
the boy—that Jimmy,” she said, “with you
to-morrow. I can’t say I believe all the good
is to result that you think; but you can try
the scheme. He’ll probably worry the life out
of you—tease the animals almost to death,
and get into innumerable scrapes—and I
should think you had enough trouble without
calling this down on your head. But you can
take him.”</p>

<p>Miss Parrott shut the door after Mrs. Pepper,
feeling extraordinarily light of heart.
“I wish I were going to the circus, too,” she
said. Then she brought herself up, “What
has come over me at my time of life? How
I act!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Skinner, down on Fletcher Road, had
just lighted her oil lamp. It gave out a pleasant
twinkle through the window, as Mrs. Pepper
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“I was just a-packin’ up th’ wash for them
boarders over to the Hill,” she said, lifting a
flushed face from the basket at her feet.
“An’ Jimmy is goin’ to carry it over.” A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
proud smile ran up to her eyes that she turned
on the big awkward boy.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said Mrs. Pepper. Then
without more ado, she gave Miss Parrott’s
invitation. It had two different effects. It
sent Mrs. Skinner down on a pile of clothes
waiting in a chair to be sorted and washed.
She raised both red toil-worn hands.
“Glory!” was all she was able to utter.
Jimmy stood perfectly still, but his eyes burned
into Mrs. Pepper’s face.</p>

<p>“And now be at the little brown house to-morrow,
Jimmy, by eleven o’clock,” Mrs. Pepper
made speedy work of it, and got herself
out to carry the joyful news home.</p>

<p>Could it really be true that her children were
to see a circus at last, or was she dreaming?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>THE CIRCUS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN they were all packed in to the big
Parrott coach, ready to start for the day
at Cherryville, things couldn’t have been better
for a beginning. There was Mrs. Pepper with
Phronsie on her lap, then Davie next, and in
the corner, Jimmy fixed up in the jacket his
mother had worked on as to patches, up to the
last moment.</p>

<p>And over on the other seat were Polly and
Joel and Ben—just a good half-dozen and
one of Badgertown folks going to their first
circus.</p>

<p>For once Joel could say nothing. The wonderful
expedition had stunned him, and he sat
with folded hands, and eyes big with suppressed
excitement. Ben was the one who did
the talking, and he bubbled over in the most
unusual fashion, so that Polly kept bobbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
her smiles and delighted appreciation over
Joel’s head, at intervals all through the ride.
It was so good to see Ben merry, and to know
that he was going to have a good time for once
in his life.</p>

<p>But once the circus-ground was reached,
Joel found his tongue. He sprang out the
first, and a volley of questions were fired,
sometimes to the Peppers, and just as often as
not, into the air. It made no difference, for
Joel couldn’t wait to get the answers.</p>

<p>Mother Pepper kept her brood together, and
waited while Simmons carried out the instructions
of Miss Parrott, and bought the tickets,
and got the big lunch-basket down. Then he
considered his duties were all done, until after
the performance he should pick the party up
for the return trip.</p>

<p>“I’m going to carry the things to eat,” cried
Joel, tugging at the big basket as it was set on
the ground.</p>

<p>“You let that basket alone, Joe,” commanded
Ben.</p>

<p>Joel dropped the handle as if it were hot, then
he whirled around to make a bee-line for the
string of red carts where the animals had been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>“See here,” Ben gave a dash, seized him
and brought him back. “You stay here with
us.”</p>

<p>“Now, children,” Mother Pepper smiled on
the eager-eyed group, “there are two things
to remember—we must all keep together, and
we mustn’t crowd nor push other people.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see things,” began Joel.</p>

<p>“We can see a great deal more if we don’t
push,” said Mamsie, “and we can enjoy it
better.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of Joel,” said Ben, his
fingers holding the small calico sleeve, “so you
won’t have to look out for him, Mamsie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want Ben to take care of me!”
Joel howled and squirmed to get free, but as
Ben’s fingers only gripped the tighter, it wasn’t
much use.</p>

<p>“Joel is going to be a good boy, I’m sure,”
said Mother Pepper, smiling down at him.</p>

<p>Joel drew himself up. “I’m going to be
good,” he said proudly.</p>

<p>“Well, in the first place, we must think
what we will do with the lunch-basket,” said
Mrs. Pepper. “Ben can’t carry it around
until it is time to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>“Let’s eat the things now, Mamsie,” begged
Joel, tearing off his gaze from the beautiful
red carts and other entrancing equipment of
the show scattered over the big field.</p>

<p>“Why, Joel Pepper!” exclaimed Polly, with
a little laugh, “we haven’t hardly begun the
day. The idea of eating!”</p>

<p>“I can eat,” said Joel in an injured tone.
“I’m awful hungry.”</p>

<p>Just then up came Simmons. He even
touched his hat to Mrs. Pepper, a courtesy he
was just beginning to observe, for little-brown-house
people didn’t at all appeal to him. He
scraped his throat, “Miss Parrott said I was
to take care of the lunch-basket.” He was
about to say, “I forgot to tell you,” but he
couldn’t quite make up his mind to utter such
a story, although he had planned it all out,
intending to keep the whole day to himself
without the bother of such people on his mind.
Instead, here he was saying, “She said I was
to bring it to you when you were ready for it.”</p>

<p>So there was that trouble settled. And the
tickets being in Mother Pepper’s hand, up she
went with all her brood to the little narrow
walk between the stakes of the tent, where a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
big man, his hat on the back of his head, sat
in a chair.</p>

<p>“Seven,” he said, taking them to count, and
he tore off the numbers, and pushed them into
her hand, “that’s right. Step in, mar’m.”
And into the tent they all stepped, Joel and
Ben crowding together, for the small calico
sleeve still had to be held, of course.</p>

<p>The grass was all trodden hard beneath their
feet, and everything seemed to smell of peanuts,
that boys were carrying about in baskets,
bawling out their wares—people eating out
of the bags they had just bought, and scattering
the shells to right and to left.</p>

<p>No one of the Peppers said a word about
“peanuts” and they all tried not to look at
the baskets, for they had settled that matter
when they knew they were going to the circus.</p>

<p>Polly began it, and Ben helped her, getting
the children together in a corner of the kitchen,
“You know we haven’t any money to spend,
and it will make Mamsie feel just dreadfully
if we look as if we wanted things,” so they
had all promised they wouldn’t look at the
things. But now it was pretty hard work with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
so many baskets, and boys poking them in their
faces. Didn’t the peanuts smell good though!
At last Joel had to hold his little stubby nose
tightly with his fingers. Then he suddenly
dropped them.</p>

<p>“I’m going up on top,” he screamed, as several
boys dashed by scrambling over the rows
of boards that encircled the big ring, and he
twitched himself free.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” said Ben, dashing after,
“we’ve got to sit where our tickets say.”</p>

<p>But Joel wildly protested that he was going
where those other boys were, who now on the
tip top seat were laughing and jeering people
down below, and acting dreadfully.</p>

<p>One of the circus men passing by, said
“Jiminy! I wouldn’t want to hold that eel,”
to Ben.</p>

<p>Joel turned his wild gaze down to the man,
“I’m not an eel,” he said, and his black eyes
blazed.</p>

<p>“You are,” said the man, looking back as
he hurried off, “a slippery, squirmy old eel and
I’ve a good mind to douse you into the fish-tank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>“He sha’n’t,” roared Joel, and he beat his
small fists together, “and I’m going after him,
and smash him.”</p>

<p>“You’d get smashed yourself,” said Ben.
“Now aren’t you ashamed, Joel; everybody’s
looking at us. Mamsie will have to take us
home if you act so.”</p>

<p>Joel’s fists flew apart, and he glanced quickly
around. “There isn’t anybody,” he began,
but an old woman in a poke bonnet came up.
“Is the little boy sick?” she asked, in great
concern.</p>

<p>“No,” said Ben, “I’m afraid he’s naughty.”</p>

<p>“That’s very bad,” said the old woman severely
and shaking her poke bonnet at him.
“I sh’d take him right home if I was you.
Folks want to enjoy a circus and th’ animiles in
peace without having boys act like Kedar.”</p>

<p>“I think he’s going to be good,” said Ben.
His face was very red, and he would have
given a great deal to have the old woman pass
along. Oh, if Mamsie and the others were to
come up! But she stayed. “I d’now,” she said,
“I don’t set no gret by boys. You never
know what they’re up to unless they’re sick.
Sure he ain’t?” She peered at Joel’s little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
scowling face, and drew out a small bottle
from a black silk bag dangling on her arm.
“Now two or three drops of this,” and she
pulled out the cork.</p>

<p>It smelt dreadfully as it was put under Joel’s
little nose, and he bobbed his head back and
threw up his arm. Away went the bottle with
the black stuff, and the old woman with the
poke bonnet ran after it, as it fell on the sawdust
just inside the rope ring.</p>

<p>“Here, keep out of there!” roared a circus
man, tearing along up, and leaping the rope,
he seized her shawl.</p>

<p>“I’m getting my bottle,” she said angrily,
“that boy there,” she pointed to Joel, “threw
it over here, and he’s spilt, most all of my
med’cine.” She held it up to the light.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Ben, hurrying over, “my
brother didn’t throw it—it was an accident.”</p>

<p>“She stuck it up to my nose,” said Joel, hurrying
up, wrathfully, “she hadn’t any business
to. She is a bad old woman.”</p>

<p>“Joel—Joel!” Ben’s face was scarlet.
The circus man took the bottle and gave it a
good smell.</p>

<p>“<i>Phew!</i>” he said, giving it back hastily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
“Well I’d ’a’ throw’d it to Halifax. Now get
out o’ here,” he helped her over the rope, “we
don’t want no old women with bottles makin’
trouble. I’ve a good mind to put you out.”
He kept hold of her shawl.</p>

<p>The old woman, with a trembling hand, put
the cork back into the little bottle. She began
to whimper. “Oh, don’t do that. I’ve never
ben to a circus, an’ I’ve saved my money for
ever so long. Don’t put me out, Mister.”</p>

<p>Joel swallowed hard; then he plunged over.
“You mustn’t put her out. I sha’n’t let you.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” the circus man looked down at
the small figure, then he whistled.</p>

<p>“No, I sha’n’t,” said Joel, tossing his head
and his black eyes flashed. “She thought I
was sick.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” the old woman mumbled, “I
thought he was sick, and—”</p>

<p>“And I didn’t want medicine,” Joel hurried
on, “and it smelt.”</p>

<p>“I sh’d think it did,” the circus man rubbed
his nose. “Well, that’s another thing, if you
want her to stay. But I thought you said she
was bad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>Joel hung his head, and the hot color rushed
all over his little face.</p>

<p>“She didn’t mean—” he began.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the circus man. “You
can stay, old bottle woman,” he turned to her.
“I’ve got something more to do than to hang
around here to straighten out a fuss when
there don’t seem to be none.”</p>

<p>“Mister,” said the old woman, as he was
slouching off, “that boy didn’t ’xactly throw
my bottle, not ’xactly—”</p>

<p>He laughed and snapped his fingers at her,
and now he was gone for good.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s Mamsie—and the others,”
cried Ben, looking off to a middle row of seats,
where Polly was standing up and beckoning
with all her might. “Come, they’ve found
our places.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know where my seat is,”
said the old woman helplessly, and she began
to fumble in her black silk bag, “th’ man give
me somethin’ an’—”</p>

<p>Joel was dashing off to the others, but thinking
better of it, turned back. “I’ll find it for
you,” he cried, “give me the bag,” and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
waiting for permission, he seized it and getting
down on his knees, he emptied it of all its
contents on the grass.</p>

<p>It was all done before Ben could do more
than cry, “Joel!”</p>

<p>The old woman sank down on her knees
beside Joel, as he pawed among the collection
of articles spread on the grass. Strange to say
she seemed more curious to see if he would find
it than disturbed at the way her bag was
emptied.</p>

<p>“Here ’tis!” he held it up joyfully.</p>

<p>“You’re a real good boy,” exclaimed the
old woman gratefully. “Now I’ll put the
things back.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help,” said Joel, falling to on the work.
So together everything was all snug and safe
once more in the black silk bag, and the old
woman hung it on her arm again, and got up
to her feet.</p>

<p>“It’s No. 12,” said Joel, squinting at the
little piece of pasteboard. “I’ll find it for
you,” and he pranced along, Ben and the old
woman following, his black eyes eagerly scanning
the seats. “21—20,” he ran on, “15—14—why—it’s
next to Mamsie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>Sure enough. They helped the little old
woman, her poke bonnet settling over her eyes
on the ascent, up to the middle row, and down
she sat by Mrs. Pepper. When she found
who it was in the next seat, she leaned forward
and said in a loud whisper, “Your boy, the
littlest one, is an awful good boy. He helped
me consid’able.” She had not then learned
that there was a third Pepper boy, still smaller.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper beamed on her, and was just
saying, “I am so glad,” when Joel, on her
other side, burst out, “Oh, I was bad—her
bottle flew off—and it smelt bad, and I’m
sorry.”</p>

<p>“It was an accident,” said Ben hastily.
And the old woman, when she saw Mrs. Pepper’s
face, hurried to say, “’Twarn’t much
spilt, an’ anyway I’ve got enough left,” and
just then, so many people came hurrying in
that there was such a great commotion in finding
seats, as to absorb all attention. And the
first thing Joel knew, a trembling hand was
laid across Mrs. Pepper’s lap. “There’s a
dime,” said the little old woman, “I brought
it for peanuts. And you can buy some for
us all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>Joel hopped to his feet, his eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with him,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“No, no,” roared Joel, clutching the dime.
“She said me—I’m going alone,” and he began
to wriggle out of his seat.</p>

<p>Ben looked at Mrs. Pepper in dismay, as she
said quietly, “Yes, you may go, Joel, by yourself.
I can trust you.”</p>

<p>“She says I may,” Joel was already working
his way over the rows. He turned to send
a delighted smile back, and Mrs. Pepper
nodded. “I can trust you,” she said again.</p>

<p>“All them children yours?” asked the little
woman presently, craning her neck to see the
row of heads the other side of Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“All but one,” said Mrs. Pepper, “and he
is a Badgertown boy.”</p>

<p>“My sakes! hain’t you had a sight o’ trouble
though, to bring up such a lot o’ young ones.”</p>

<p>Mother Pepper turned clear around in her
seat. “Trouble?” she repeated, and her black
eyes shone, “why I never should think of such
a thing! Why, they are my <i>children</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s jest what I say—and such a
lot o’ them,” affirmed the little old woman,
bobbing her poke bonnet with emphasis, as Joel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
came rushing back swinging a big bag of peanuts.</p>

<p>“You see I thought I’d get peanuts.
There’s a sight o’ nourishment in chewin’ of
’em,” she said, taking the bag, “so I didn’t
bring nothin’ to eat.” She emptied out a small
handful into her lap. “There, boy,” and she
handed the bag back to Joel, “you an’ your
folks can have th’ rest, an’ we can sit an’ chew
on ’em together.”</p>

<p>“And we have a great deal of luncheon,”
said Mrs. Pepper, “and it will be very nice
to have you eat with us.”</p>

<p>And just then the band marched in, smart in
bright red coats and gilt helmets—with a
blare of trumpets, to announce the approach
of the grand procession.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>MORE ABOUT THE CIRCUS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">“I HAIN’T never ben to a circus,” said
the little old woman, after the splendor
of the grand procession had swept around
the ring, and she caught her breath.</p>

<p>“We have never been to one,” said Mrs.
Pepper, looking down the length of her row
of absorbed faces.</p>

<p>“Is that so? Why, I thought ev’rybody had
had a chance at one, ’xcept me— An’ I says,
‘Now, next time it comes to Cherryville, I’ll
go.’ I’d ben a-savin’ up for it, for circuses
don’t wait for folks to turn back an’ grow
young. Look at them ponies—did you ever
see sech mites!”</p>

<p>She leaned forward, her withered face suddenly
looking as if she had indeed “turned
back to grow young.”</p>

<p>“You’re pokin’ me in the back somethin’
dreadful,” said a woman in front, with an indignant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
face over her shoulder. The head
was surmounted with a hat topped off with a
big pink bow wound around a higher bunch
of yellow roses.</p>

<p>“I s’pose so,” said the little old woman,
“but I have to poke, to get the best of that
contraption on your head—I’ve got to see;
that’s what I come for.”</p>

<p>The woman with the hat flounced back and
threw her head up higher yet.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to stand up,” said the
little old woman, tired of twisting first one
side and then the other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper, her mind down the line where
Phronsie in absorbed delight over the ponies,
was sitting between Polly and David, had no
eyes for her neighbor’s distress. Now she
laid her hand on the rusty black shawl. “I’m
so much taller,” she said, and before anybody
quite knew it, the little old woman was in the
seat next to Joel, and Mother Pepper’s black
eyes were gazing over the “contraption” of a
hat.</p>

<p>And, then, after the ponies, came the elephants—the
big one and the little one.
Phronsie shivered when the old one marched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
ponderously into the ring, and threw herself
over into Polly’s lap.</p>

<p>“He won’t hurt you,” whispered Polly, her
arms about her.</p>

<p>“And he isn’t half as bad as Polly’s rhododendron,”
said Ben, leaning forward to talk
across.</p>

<p>Polly turned a cold shoulder to Ben. “See
the little elephant, Phronsie—see him!”</p>

<p>“Is there a little one?” said Phronsie, uncovering
one blue eye fearfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Polly, “and he’s such
a dear little elephant, Phronsie. Do look!”</p>

<p>“He’s a dear little el’phunt,” cooed
Phronsie, bringing both eyes into view. But
she sighed after the ponies, now careering on
the other side of the big ring, drawing the
little chariot gay with ribbons and flags, and
a small boy and a smaller girl riding in state.</p>

<p>“I wish they’d come again,” she said, pulling
Polly’s head down to whisper in her ear.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will,” said Polly encouragingly,
“and if they don’t, there’ll be something
else just as splendid.”</p>

<p>Phronsie folded her hands in her lap and
sat quite still. Could anything be as splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
as those sweet little ponies? And she sighed
again. But Polly had said so, and it must
be true.</p>

<p>Meantime David, who had scarcely dared
to breathe through the whole show, screamed
right out.</p>

<p>Everybody turned and stared, and a nervous
woman down in the front said, “Gracious!
somebody’s sick—get th’ doctor.” And one
of the funny men in a white coat with red
spots all over it, and a hat with holes where
his eyes came, looked up as he was walking
down beneath the seats saying things to make
people laugh.</p>

<p>“Toss me that boy,” he roared, snapping
a little whip he carried under his arm, “and
I’ll eat him up.”</p>

<p>And at that, Joel screamed, “You sha’n’t
eat my brother—I’ll smash you!” And
everything was in a commotion. And a man
in a red coat, with a good many brass buttons
on it, rushed up and said: “You’re disturbing
the show—I’ll put you out if you make any
more trouble.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Pepper leaned over past the little
old woman. Polly caught one glimpse of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
Mamsie’s distressed face, and she swept
Phronsie over into Ben’s lap.</p>

<p>“Oh, Davie—what is it?” she cried,
huddling him up against her, as he buried his
face in her neck.</p>

<p>“The bears! Joel has always wanted to
see some—they’re coming!”</p>

<p>Joel, with no heart for bears or anything
else, was still shaking his little brown fists and
declaring that he wouldn’t let any one eat up
his brother, while Big Bruin and Mrs. Bruin
and two small Bruins were doing their best
down in the ring to make the parade lively.</p>

<p>“Oh, Davie!” cried Polly, so mortified that
she forgot herself, “you shouldn’t have
screamed. We’re so ashamed!” While
Mother Pepper said, quietly, “Joel,” and down
went his little fists, and he stopped right in the
middle of a word.</p>

<p>David was so still that Polly bent her hot
cheek over him. “Why, Davie, are you
sick?” she cried in sudden fright.</p>

<p>Davie tried to say “No,” but the word
wouldn’t come. And before he had time to
begin again, Mrs. Pepper had quietly worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
her way past the little old woman and Joel,
and there he was in her lap.</p>

<p>“There, it’s all right, Davie,” she said,
“Mother knows all about it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve made—I’ve made—you all—ashamed,”
said Davie in little shivery gasps,
throwing his arms around her neck.</p>

<p>“You will make us very much ashamed,”
said Mrs. Pepper, “unless you sit up now,
and be Mother’s good boy.”</p>

<p>“Will I?” David raised a little face that
was quite white. The soft waves of light hair
tumbled over his forehead.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” Mother Pepper brushed
them back soothingly.</p>

<p>“I will be your good boy, Mamsie,” said
David, sitting up in her lap, his miserable little
face brightening a bit.</p>

<p>“He better take some o’ this med’cine.”
The little old woman tried to pass the small
bottle she picked out of her black silk bag. “I
always carry it everywhere’s I go, ef I sh’d be
sick.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Pepper shook her head. And Joel
being now absorbed in the bears that somehow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
were determined not to march with the
others, but to get up a show all by themselves,
till the trainer with his little whip had to get
them into line, everything became quiet once
more.</p>

<p>Well, after the grand parade, there was the
big show when the animals did the most surprising
things, and the men and the women
in spangles and satin and velvet jumped from
horses going at top speed—or through hoops,
or swung in the air like big birds.</p>

<p>And then there was a great to-do, everybody
clambering down from the seats—all
trying to get out of the tent at once.</p>

<p>In and out of the crowd Miss Parrott’s
coachman worked his way, with the big lunch-basket.</p>

<p>“I thought you would like to have it now,”
he said. And he didn’t forget to touch his
hat to Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“I think it is time,” said Mrs. Pepper, “for
I believe everybody is hungry,” with a smile
that included the little old woman next to Joel.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you a place where you can sit
and eat, and not have many people around,”
said Simmons, going off with the big basket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
and all the Peppers hurried down from their
seats to follow. But not before Mrs. Pepper
took hold of Joel’s little calico sleeve. “Help
her down, Joey,” she said, nodding her head
toward the little old woman.</p>

<p>“I want to go with Dave,” grumbled Joel.</p>

<p>“Help her down, Joel,” said Mother Pepper
distinctly.</p>

<p>“And I’ll help her, too,” cried Davie, turning
back.</p>

<p>“So you shall,” Mrs. Pepper beamed at
him, so that he forgot for the first time how
he had made them all ashamed.</p>

<p>And Joel on one side and Davie on the
other, made the little old woman say when she
was safely down from her seat on the middle
row, “My sakes, I never had no gret likin’ for
boys before. What’s your name, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Joel, who was frantic to hurry along, as the
others and Miss Parrott’s coachman were well
ahead, had no time to answer questions. So
Davie said, “He’s Joel Pepper, and I—”</p>

<p>“Pepper? What a name!” interrupted the
little old woman with a snort.</p>

<p>Davie’s face got very red.</p>

<p>Luckily Joel didn’t hear; all his mind was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
bent on getting along faster as he beat his
hands together aching to pull the little old
woman on by her rusty shawl.</p>

<p>“Joel is a good-enough name,” said the little
old woman. “My husband’s father was
Joel, but Pepper is a perfectly dreadful name.”</p>

<p>“Pepper is just a perfectly splendid name!”
David stopped short by her side, and looked
at her out of flashing blue eyes.</p>

<p>“My sakes alive!” exclaimed the little old
woman, stopping aghast, “I sh’d as soon
’xpect a hummin’ bird to dare me, as you.
Now ef it had ’a’ ben him,” she shook her black
silk bag at Joel, who was marching on. Joel
looked back and screamed, “Come on!” which
they did, redoubling their speed.</p>

<p>“Now, my name is a sensible one,” said the
little old woman, “Jones. But Pepper—I
sh’d as soon think of salt and mustard.”</p>

<p>David, finding it harder and harder to escort
a person determined to find fault with his
name, had all he could do to keep himself from
deserting altogether. But knowing that Mamsie
would feel badly if he did, and remembering
how he had made them all ashamed, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
marched on, by her side; but his head was
tossed up, and his cheeks were very red.</p>

<p>But in the excitement of getting into the
corner of the field around the big lunch-basket
that Simmons put in their midst, no one
noticed him but Mother Pepper.</p>

<p>“Tell Mother,” whispered Mrs. Pepper,
under cover of getting the good things unpacked.</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” said David desperately, “that
lady is a bad old lady. Don’t make me sit
next to her,” he begged.</p>

<p>“Why, Davie boy!” exclaimed Mrs. Pepper
in surprise. “I think she is quite a nice
little woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Davie shook his head. “She’s
been saying awful things. She doesn’t like
us to be called Pepper.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper burst into a cheery laugh.
“Well, that’s not being bad,” she said.
“Now perhaps I shouldn’t like her name, if
I knew what it was.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Davie, “she told me—it’s
Jones.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like it. I never did like it,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
said Mrs. Pepper, “so you see, Davie, it isn’t
so much matter if people’s names don’t suit
other folks. But the people themselves have
got to be just right. Now run along and be
nice to her. She is poor and old. Remember
that, Davie boy.”</p>

<p>There was everything in that fine big
lunch-basket. First came a table-cloth and
napkins as fresh and sweet as if they had been
packed away in lavender, as indeed was the
case. Then seven little cups—and a big jar
of lemonade, piles of bread and butter and
cold chicken, cake, and biscuits. Was ever
such a feast spread out for hungry people at
a circus!</p>

<p>Jimmy, who hadn’t said a word all through
the show, but had absorbed it with all his eyes
and ears, now hung back from the group and
leaned up against the wall of a shed a little
distance away. He was watching the merry
party with longing.</p>

<p>Ben, helping Polly to spread the table-cloth
on the grass, looked off and saw him.</p>

<p>“Give us a hand, Jimmy,” he said.</p>

<p>Jimmy started, then stopped, hanging back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>“Come on,” said Polly, “and take hold of
this other corner, please.”</p>

<p>So there Jimmy was, and the table-cloth
being spread, the articles from the basket were
soon in place, everybody being handy at getting
them out, Joel and David especially so,
while Phronsie got in between, laughing and
crowing happily under the impression that she
was helping very much.</p>

<p>“I think I will visit with you,” said Mother
Pepper, sitting down on the grass next to the
little old woman. There was a happy look in
her black eyes, and a soft color began to come
on her cheek, “and let the children take care
of things.”</p>

<p>The little old woman raised her withered
face and regarded her curiously. “You ain’t
a bit of a fussbudget,” she said.</p>

<p>“No?” replied Mother Pepper. Then she
laughed and said, “Why should I be?”</p>

<p>“La! you shouldn’t be. But a woman
who’s got a raft o’ young ones most generally
is.”</p>

<p>“They are my <i>children</i>,” said Mrs. Pepper
softly, and her happy eyes roved over the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>
bunch of Peppers. Bursts of laughter came
from the group, in which Jimmy’s voice could
now and then be heard.</p>

<p>“Who’s that boy?” abruptly demanded the
little old woman.</p>

<p>“That’s Jimmy Skinner, a Badgertown
boy,” said Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“Oh, then he ain’t a Pepper?”</p>

<p>“No. Well, children,” Mrs. Pepper got up
to her feet, “you are all ready now, aren’t
you? We better begin, for we want as much
time as we can spare to see the animals, you
know.”</p>

<p>At mention of the “animals” there was
great excitement, Joel beating his hands together
and shouting, “Let’s begin—let’s
begin!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamsie, please sit here,” cried Polly,
patting one end of the table-cloth, “and
Mrs.—”</p>

<p>“Jones,” said Davie, coming to the rescue,
“that’s Mrs. Jones,” and he held out a hand
to help the little old woman up from the grass.</p>

<p>“Jones I am—but I ain’t no Missis,” said
the little old woman, getting up stiffly to her
feet. “My! but I feel like a wooden-jointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
doll! I’m Susannah Jones—that’s th’ handle
to my name. Well, where’ll I set?”</p>

<p>“Right next to Mamsie,” said Polly.</p>

<p>Miss Susannah Jones let her pale eyes rove
all around the circle. “What?” she said in
a puzzled way. “Where?”</p>

<p>“Why, here,” said Polly, with a little laugh,
and leading her to Mrs. Pepper. “This is
Mamsie,” and she laughed again.</p>

<p>Miss Susannah opened her thin lips. She
was just about to say, “Well, of all the queer
names, <i>that</i> is!” when, glancing at Davie’s face,
she thought better of it. And besides it was
no worse than Pepper. So she sat down and
the feast began.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper, glancing across the table-cloth
at Jimmy, saw something that made her say,
“Come here a minute,” and as he shuffled
around to her side, she whispered to him,
“What is it that makes you afraid to save your
cake?”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s freckled face got very red. He
scrubbed his rusty shoes back and forth in the
grass. Then he said, “I didn’t want you folks
to see.”</p>

<p>“You want to give it to somebody?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>Jimmy nodded his tow head, glad enough
that he didn’t have to speak any more.</p>

<p>“You may,” said Mrs. Pepper kindly, “do
just as you like with it.”</p>

<p>“May I?”</p>

<p>“Indeed you may,” declared Mother Pepper.
“So don’t hide your cake under the
table-cloth—but keep it on your plate, and
you shall have a paper to do it up in when we
all get through.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want no paper,” said Jimmy
bluntly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jimmy, you can’t carry it home in
your hand.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t going to carry it home—and the
boy won’t mind.”</p>

<p>“The boy?” Mrs. Pepper looked very
puzzled.</p>

<p>“There’s a boy over there,” Jimmy pointed
off in the direction of the big red cart standing
in the field, “and he keeps looking and looking
at us—and I guess he’s hungry.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper turned a swift eye in that direction.
“Jimmy,” she said, “I think you are
right. Wouldn’t you like to carry your cake
to him now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>“Wouldn’t I just!” exclaimed Jimmy, finding
a ready tongue, and springing off on just
as ready feet.</p>

<p>“Oh!” screamed Joel, “look at Jimmy—running
off with his cake! See, Mamsie, Jimmy
is—”</p>

<p>“Joel!” Mother Pepper didn’t need to say
more, as everybody whirled around to see the
Badgertown boy skim over the grass clutching
his slices of cake that he had been tucking
under the table-cloth.</p>

<p>Joel ducked, and everybody else was quiet
except Miss Susannah.</p>

<p>“That Badgertown boy is jest as bad as th’
rest o’ you,” she said, between the bites on her
own piece of cake, as Jimmy slipped back and
into his seat, but not to eat any cake.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said Mrs. Pepper, when
everything was cleaned up neatly, and the big
basket had been handed to Simmons, who appeared
at the right time, “we’ll start to see the
animals.”</p>

<p>Joel screamed, “The bears—the <i>bears</i>!
Oh, let’s see the bears first.”</p>

<p>“We will take them all in order, Joey. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
the bears are at the beginning of the line, why
we will see them first.”</p>

<p>“The monkeys,” cried Phronsie, pulling at
her mother’s hand. “Oh, I want to see the
dear sweet little monkeys, Mamsie!”</p>

<p>“We are going to see the monkeys,
Phronsie, and all the rest of them,” said Mrs.
Pepper in a happy voice.</p>

<p>Polly couldn’t help jumping up and down
and clapping her hands in joy, her two brown
braids flying out.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to visit your rhododendron,
Polly,” said Ben, catching hold of her
to stop her and say it over her shoulder. But
Polly pretending not to hear, the words were
lost in the babel of delight that ensued. And
Mrs. Pepper was asking the little old woman
if she would like to go with them to see the
animals.</p>

<p>“Indeed I would,” cried Miss Susannah.
“My! I was wonderin’ how in th’ world I’d
ever get around amongst those anim<i>iles</i> an’
rep<i>tiles</i>. Say, do you Peppers family always
go about th’ world lookin’ out for other
folks?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>“We don’t go about the world,” said Mrs.
Pepper, with a little laugh. “Well, now, we
must start.”</p>

<p>As it happened the bears were first in the
line, so Joel had his wish, and he crowded up
plastering his face close to their cage, in which
the beasts had been put on their return from
the parade in the ring.</p>

<p>“That boy will get his nose clawed off,”
said a man in the crowd. Mrs. Pepper
turned, “<i>Joel!</i>” she cried, just in time! Out
came old Father Bear’s paw with its five cruel
claws as sharp as knives,—and a sudden
scratch went <i>sizz</i> on the iron bars just where
Joel’s face had been.</p>

<p>“He didn’t get me,” said Joel vindictively,
staring into the wicked little eyes of the bear
snapping angrily at him.</p>

<p>“Now look here, Joe,” Ben broke through
the crowd to him, “you’ll keep away from the
cages, or I’ll hold you every single minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to be held,” howled Joel,
squirming to get free, “don’t hold me, Ben; I’ll
be good.”</p>

<p>“I shall hold you,” said Ben firmly, “unless
you’ll promise not to touch the cages. Aren’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
you ashamed, Joel?” he said in a lower voice.
“Everybody is looking at you.”</p>

<p>“I want to see the bears,” roared Joel. All
the world might be looking at him. He was
in such an anguish that he didn’t care. He
<i>must</i> see the bears!</p>

<p>“Well, promise,” said Ben, “and I’ll let you
go.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see ’em,” fretted Joel, “unless I
go close.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can; nobody else touches the
cages.”</p>

<p>Joel swept the crowd with his black eyes,
disdainfully.</p>

<p>“Just look at Mamsie,” Ben leaned over
and whispered this into Joel’s ear. Mrs. Pepper,
holding Phronsie’s hand, was looking at
him. Her face was white, but she smiled.</p>

<p>“I won’t go near those bears,” said Joel.
“O dear!” He tried not to cry, but it was no
use. The tears dripped down through the
fingers clapped up to his face, and trailed all
down his calico blouse.</p>

<p>“Now that’s all nonsense, Joe,” said Ben,
releasing his hold. “You can go just as near
as I do, and all the other folks. I’ll trust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>
you,” and Ben slipped away to prove his
words.</p>

<p>Joel felt somebody tugging at one of the
hands over his wet little face. “There’s a
good place over there,” said Davie, pointing
to a little space where two men who hadn’t
been able to forget that they had once been
boys, were holding it open for him. They
spread it out a little further so that Davie
could slip in, too.</p>

<p>It was some time before Joel was willing
to leave the bears. Father Bear, who couldn’t
forgive the boy who made him miss such a
well-aimed scratch, kept pacing up and down,
growling and showing his teeth at him—and
altogether being so very fascinating, that a
crowd was continually in front of the cage,
staring with open mouths and eyes. At last
Mrs. Pepper gave the word to move on.</p>

<p>They had the big snakes, and a lion who
was old and tired out, and half asleep in the
corner of his cage, so that he wasn’t at all interesting,
and almost everything else in the animal
line that the circus had afforded, before
they came to the monkeys. Phronsie saw them
first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>“There they are, Mamsie!” she gave a joyful
little cry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper hurried to keep up with her,
and the others followed in close ranks, being
kept in line by Ben, who brought up the rear.</p>

<p>A small boy who was just as anxious to see
monkeys as Phronsie, rushed in between,
knocking off the pink sunbonnet. It had been
so hot in the crowd that Phronsie had untied
it, and now away it went, and a big clumsy
man set his foot right on it. Jimmy saw it
and tried to rescue it, pulling at one string;
but the people pushed about so that he was
knocked down and the string came off in his
hand. Then the big clumsy man saw what he
was stepping on, and he got off.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” Jimmy’s face was full
of distress, as somebody picked up the poor
little sunbonnet, and he held out the string.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be helped,” said Mrs. Pepper,
only glad that Phronsie was so absorbed in
delight over the monkeys that she wouldn’t
know that she had lost her sunbonnet.</p>

<p>And the monkeys seemed to think that something
special was expected of them, for they
at once set to on so many antics that there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>
nothing but crowding and pushing as everybody
came up to see, and stopped to laugh.
At last a great hulking boy came up suddenly,
back of David and pushed him against the cage.</p>

<p>This was apparently just what one of the
monkeys had been watching for. He swung
himself down from his perch, reached out a
long arm, and grabbed off David’s little cap.
Then up he leaped back again, squatted down
to bite and tear it to his heart’s content.</p>

<p>David clapped his hands to his head, and
turned very white, as a cry went up from the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad!” “He’s got the little
feller’s cap.” “Oh, what a shame!” And
one mother elbowed her way in through the
crowd to Mrs. Pepper, who had her arms
around her boy trying to comfort him. And
she herself needed sympathy, for how could
she scrape together the money for another
cap? “I know who the boy is that pushed
him, and I’ll tell his father—he’ll give him
a good beating.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Mrs. Pepper, “don’t do that.
Davie doesn’t want you to. Do you, Davie
dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>“No, I don’t,” said Davie, through his sobs.
Then when he saw his mother’s face, he wiped
away the tears and managed to smile through
them. “I can go without a cap,” he said.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>DAVID’S CAP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. PEPPER turned away for a moment,
not trusting herself to speak.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind it—much,” Davie pulled at
her shawl, and looked anxiously at her face
as she turned back.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” she said comfortingly, as she
led him out of the crowd. “Mother will see
how she can fix it up for you, Davie boy.”</p>

<p>“The monkey’s spitting out the pieces of
your cap,” cried some boys after him, and they
laughed and doubled up in glee.</p>

<p>“Shame on you for laughing,” cried the
woman who wanted to tell the boy’s father.
But it was no use to stop the crowd—they
cheered and guffawed as they pressed up closer
to the cage, where the monkey on his high
perch was biting out pieces of David’s little
cap, and throwing them off toward the bars,
grinning dreadfully between each bite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span>Joel rushed up to see the fun. He had
stayed as long as he could at the cage of big
snakes, Ben finally hauling him away, and now,
with Polly and Jimmy, they hurried up to join
Mrs. Pepper and Phronsie.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Joel, thrusting in his
hot little face wherever he saw a crack of space
to get it in. “Oh, what is it he’s got?”</p>

<p>“A boy’s cap bein’ et up,” said a man, stopping
his laugh long enough to shoot this out.</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to see!” By a way Joel best
knew would secure a good place, he was pretty
soon worked in, till there he was in the front
row with the other boys still screaming with
the fun of the thing.</p>

<p>There the monkey sat on a high perch, biting
very slowly now in order to make the cap last
as long as possible. His little eyes were
twinkling, and his paws were kept busy to
hold the cap, and fight off the other monkeys,
who now swarmed and chattered around him,
in order to seize the beautiful thing that was
making the people so noisy with delight.</p>

<p>“What is it he’s got?” cried Joel, wrinkling
up his face trying to see the wad in the
monkey’s paw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span>“A boy’s cap—he twitched it off his head.
Oh, Jiminy—see!”</p>

<p>The monkey, fearing that the other monkeys
might be too many for him to hold his prize,
took a last big bite from it, spit out the pieces,
and threw them derisively right at the bars,
and into Joel’s face pressed against them.
One piece fell out at his feet; it said “—vid
Pepper” just where Mamsie had marked it on
the rim of the cap.</p>

<p>Joel’s brown hand closed convulsively over
it, and he looked wildly around. Then he put
down his head, and bolted right through the
middle of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Mercy sakes!” the woman screamed,—the
boys who had laughed skipped nimbly out
of the way,—and nobody thought the case
quite so funny as it had been.</p>

<p>“Mamsie, where are you?” screamed Joel.
He almost threw Polly over, for he was beyond
seeing anything or anybody in his mad
rush, and Ben wasn’t quick enough to catch
him. It was Jimmy who did it.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” cried Joel frantically, and he
kicked Jimmy’s shins. But Jimmy’s hand was
just as tight for all that, on Joel’s arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span>“He’s chewed it all up,” cried Joel wildly,
as Polly and Ben ran up. “Let me <i>go</i>!”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” and Ben got hold of the
other arm, “what’s that in your hand, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Dave’s cap,” Joel flung open his hand.
There it was, with “—vid Pepper” on what
remained of the rim.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamsie!” and the horrified little
group looked up into Mother Pepper’s face.
And there was Phronsie, who hadn’t understood
anything only that she must leave the
dear sweet little monkeys—and Davie, his
light hair in soft waves over his forehead,
crowded up to Mrs. Pepper’s side. His hands
were tightly clasped and he closed his eyes to
squeeze back the tears.</p>

<p>“No, no, Polly,” said Mrs. Pepper, for
Polly was just beginning, “Why, Mamsie,
what—” “we won’t have the story now, and
see—there is Simmons coming for us. It’s
time to go home.”</p>

<p>When they were once in Miss Parrott’s big
coach, the story all came out. Simmons on
his coachman’s box, alternately drew himself
up straighter than ever, and then shrank down
in a way he couldn’t remember doing when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span>
on duty as befitted holding his aristocratic position
in the community.</p>

<p>“I won’t tell her—the Missus acts bad
enough as ’tis over them poor childern. What
if he did lose his cap!” Away he drove in
great form down a hundred yards or so.
Then he pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>“Oh, Davie,” Polly was saying mournfully
within the coach, “it’s too bad! Mamsie,
what shall we do!”</p>

<p>Simmons didn’t hear Mrs. Pepper’s reply.
Down his shoulders went and he drooped, letting
the reins slacken. And then he straightened
up again, quite determined to let matters
alone. But as he drove up to the little brown
house, and watched them all get out, he
couldn’t help but see Davie’s face.</p>

<p>He looked back over his shoulder to watch
them go up the path, not taking his gaze off
till they were all in, and the green door shut.</p>

<p>“I s’pose I’d felt pretty bad when I warn’t
no bigger’n him, to lose my cap, if I didn’t
know where to get another. Thunder!”</p>

<p>And before he even put up his horses, Miss
Parrott had the whole story.</p>

<p>“I presume they keep boys’ caps down at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span>
the store, Simmons?” said Miss Parrott
quickly.</p>

<p>“That they do, Ma’am,” said Simmons.</p>

<p>“And perhaps you could tell Mr. Atkins the
right size?”</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be no trouble about that,
Ma’am.”</p>

<p>There was a little transaction with money
that came out of Miss Parrott’s black silk bag,
and Simmons hurried out to take care of his
horses, before he attended to the matter that
now began to appear quite important to him.</p>

<p>Jimmy, his hand thrust into the pockets his
mother hadn’t been able to make quite whole,
turned down to the little cabin on Fletcher
Road called “Mrs. Skinner’s house.” The
loss of David’s cap bothered him dreadfully
on top of the other matter connected with the
circus boy. Jimmy wasn’t able to get him out
of his mind. While the cake was rapidly disappearing,
he had heard the story of being
“starved and beaten,” the boy looking for
more, in a way that struck Jimmy harder than
the loss of his own treasured part of the feast.</p>

<p>“I can’t help him none,” he declared, with
a reckless twitch of his shoulders, “no more’n<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span>
I could get a new cap for Mis Pepper’s boy.”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, “Can’t I help get a
cap for David Pepper?”</p>

<p>He took off his own cap and scratched his
head. That did no good, and he flung the cap
back. He hadn’t a penny in his pocket. He
knew that without the trouble of turning the
pocket inside out. But—couldn’t he get
some work? Where?</p>

<p>It was a pretty small prospect before him,
as all Badgertown people had a poor opinion
of his desire or ability to work.</p>

<p>“What’s th’ use?” he said, kicking off some
small stones in the rough road. Then he
picked up one and shied it at a bird. He was
astonished to find that he was relieved after
all that he hadn’t hit it, and he kicked and
scuffed more stones. That gave him an idea.</p>

<p>Away back, almost a year before, a farmer
in the north end of the township had asked
him to “pick rocks” in a barren field to be
cleared for cultivation. Jimmy had said “Not
much!”—and turned off with a laugh. Suppose
the farmer wanted him now! It wasn’t
a pretty job, Jimmy knew, breaking one’s back,
and hauling and piling the stones. But—well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span>
he could ask; it wouldn’t do any harm to
do that.</p>

<p>Jimmy turned in at the door. Mrs. Skinner
lifted a hot red face from the steaming wash-tub.
All hours of the day were her work-times.</p>

<p>“Well,” she beamed in great and unusual
contentment, resting her hands on the tub rim,
“and was the circus fine?”</p>

<p>“Prime,” said Jimmy, “I’m coming back,”
slamming the door.</p>

<p>“I want to hear—” began his mother in
terrible disappointment. But he was already
half-way down Fletcher Road.</p>

<p>“No,” said the farmer, just getting up from
his supper, “you’re too late. Them rocks was
all picked, an’ I’m plowin’ th’ field.”</p>

<p>“Tell him about Badger’s land,” said his
wife, gathering up the remains of the supper.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, see here,” called the farmer,
“Badger wants th’ rocks picked from his land.
I guess you can get a job there.”</p>

<p>When Jimmy dragged himself back from
“Badger’s,” the lamps and candles had been
lighted for some time in the cottages along
the road. He looked for Mrs. Pepper’s as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span>
passed the little brown house. There she was
over by the table sewing. Jimmy had a pang
as he thought how many stitches she would
have to set before Davie’s loss could be made
good. He didn’t know that a brand-new cap
had been handed in, and that after the jollification
over it had spent itself, Davie had
taken it up into the loft to hang by the side
of the shake-down, the first thing his eyes
would rest upon the next morning.</p>

<p>That next morning, the old kitchen was just
the jolliest place, full of the circus and its delightful
memories. Davie, with his new cap
on his head, was prancing around, the center
of observation.</p>

<p>“It’s a perfectly beautiful cap!” declared
Polly, for nobody knows how many times,
and stopping on her way for the broom to
sweep up.</p>

<p>“I wish the monkey had eaten mine up,”
said Joel discontentedly.</p>

<p>“You may wear mine.” David stopped
prancing, and twitched off his cap.</p>

<p>“No, no, Davie,” said Polly, “Miss Parrott
sent you that cap, and she wouldn’t like
you not to wear it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span>“And if a monkey should eat mine,” said
Joel, just as well pleased, “I guess Miss Parrott
will give me one. I don’t want yours,
Dave.” With that David clapped on his cap
again, and Joel seizing him about the waist,
they spun round and round the kitchen, getting
in the way of Polly’s broom, and hindering
dreadfully. All of a sudden, down fell David,
and Joel on top of him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t make him,” cried Joel, in dismay
and hopping up, as Polly threw down the
broom and ran over.</p>

<p>“He didn’t make me,” gasped Davie, getting
up. The new cap had fallen off long
before, and Polly had picked it up to hang it
carefully on a nail. “It was my shoe.”</p>

<p>“Your shoe?” repeated Mrs. Pepper over
by the window. “What is the matter with
your shoe? Come here, David.” She laid
down the sewing in her lap, as David scuffed
across the floor.</p>

<p>“Well, that does need mending,” she said,
as David put his small foot in her lap.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry,” he began.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Mother is so glad that you
didn’t get hurt with your shoe so bad as that,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span>
she said cheerily. “Now you must get right
down to Mr. Beebe’s and ask him to sew it
up.”</p>

<p>“And mine needs mending, too,” cried Joel,
hopping over on one foot to her chair. “I
want to go to Mr. Beebe’s.”</p>

<p>“No, Joel,” said Mrs. Pepper, with a laugh,
“your shoes are perfectly sound. There now,
Davie, go right down to the shoe-shop and ask
Mr. Beebe if he will please to sew it up now—because
you haven’t any other shoes—and
walk carefully, child, else you’ll make it worse,
and besides, you might fall.”</p>

<p>“Now isn’t it nice that Davie has a new
cap?” cried Polly, going to the window,
broom in hand, to watch him as he passed
down the road. Joel had run out to go as
far as the gate with him, then he had turned
back to the woodshed, for Mrs. Pepper had
said he must pick up some kindlings.</p>

<p>“I do think folks are awfully good to us,
Mamsie,” said Polly, turning away from the
window, to pause a minute before beginning
to sweep again. “Just supposing Miss Parrott
hadn’t let us see that circus!” and her
cheeks paled at the very thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span>“Yes,” said Mrs. Pepper, and her busy
needle stopped. “Miss Parrott is good, and
God is good, to let her do it.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t He?” cried Polly, with shining eyes.
“And now to think that Davie has a new cap,
too!” as the busy needle now went hurrying
in and out. “But I never shall get this floor
swept up, if I stop all the time.”</p>

<p>Davie hurried as fast as he could, because
the shoe must be mended as soon as possible.
But he had to step carefully else a bad matter
would be made worse. At last he was over
the cobble-stones of the narrow street in front
of the shoe-shop, and lifting the knocker on
Mr. Beebe’s door.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” cried the little shoemaker,
turning away from a box of bed-slippers he
was sorting to rub his hands together delightedly,
“if here doesn’t come Davie Pepper!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said David, “I’ve come.”</p>

<p>He took off his new cap—he didn’t want
to, but Mamsie had said “Never keep a cap
on when you go to see people,” and to enter
the little shoe-shop was far more than to do
business; it was to visit friends. So he held
the new cap in his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span>“And now what can I do for you, Davie?”
asked little Mr. Beebe, coming forward.
“What has your mother sent you for?”</p>

<p>“It’s to mend my shoe,” said Davie, holding
up his foot to show where the leather flapped.</p>

<p>“So?” cried the little shoemaker, setting
his spectacles straight. “Well, now, you come
over an’ set on th’ bench, an’ we’ll see what we
shall see about that shoe.”</p>

<p>So Davie hobbled over and sat on the bench,
and the little shoe was drawn off and submitted
to a close examination, Davie following
every movement with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>“The whole o’ th’ shoe is pretty bad,” said
little Mr. Beebe slowly, pinching the well-worn
leather critically.</p>

<p>Davie drew a long breath. “And Mamsie
said would you please sew it up now, as I
haven’t any more shoes.”</p>

<p>“Sho!” exclaimed the little shoemaker.
Then he thought better of what he was going
to say. “Yes, I’ll get right to work on it,” and
pretty soon he was stitching away and cobbling
at a great rate, Davie swinging his stocking-foot,
and the other one in its rusty shoe, while
the work went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span>“Where do you suppose I went yesterday,
Mr. Beebe?” asked Davie in the midst of it.
For the little shoemaker always expected the
Pepper children to entertain him when they
came to the shop. “It makes work go easier,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Now I never can guess,” said Mr. Beebe,
waxing his long thread again.</p>

<p>“I went to the circus,” said Davie.</p>

<p>“You didn’t, though!” The little shoemaker
was genuinely surprised now, and he
dropped his needle to peer over his spectacles
at Davie.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” said Davie, with a jubilant
little crow, “and every single one of us did,
Mr. Beebe,” and he clapped his hands in delight
at the remembrance.</p>

<p>“Now do tell!” The little shoemaker was
so overwhelmed with the news that he forgot
to pick up his needle. “Well, how did you
get there?”</p>

<p>“In the big coach,” said Davie, bobbing his
head. He didn’t think it was necessary to
designate whose vehicle, as Badgertown
boasted only one.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span>“Not Miss Parrott’s!” exclaimed Mr.
Beebe.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Davie, bobbing his head again.</p>

<p>“Well, I never! She didn’t go, did she?”
exclaimed the little shoemaker.</p>

<p>“No,” this time Davie shook his head.</p>

<p>“I thought not. I sh’d as soon ’xpect one
of th’ tombstones in th’ buryin’-ground to get
sociable as her. Well, well—” here Mr.
Beebe picked up his needle and began to pull
it briskly in and out of the leather. “Now
you must tell me all about it. Begin at th’
beginnin’, Davie, an’ reel off.”</p>

<p>So Davie began, and the little shop got very
merry, Davie stopping every now and then to
laugh at the antics of the bears, and the little
ponies and the elephants and the funny men
who wore white clothes with red spots over
them, and who had holes for eyes, and who
kept walking up and down saying things to
make people laugh, or who were tumbling off
all the while from the donkeys’ backs. And
the little shoemaker wanted dreadfully to stop
cobbling to hear the better, but he knew Mrs.
Pepper expected her boy home, so he kept on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span>
with his work, every now and then grunting
out, “Well I never!” and “Who ever did!”
and the like.</p>

<p>So of course no one heard the door open,
and the big woman who walked in, exclaimed,
“Goodness, Mr. Beebe, what’s th’ matter!”</p>

<p>“There ain’t nothin’, as I know of,” said
the little shoemaker, looking up composedly,
“an’ please to shet th’ door, Mis Goodsell.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodsell pushed the door to with her
foot. “I thought you was havin’ a party by
the noise,” she said, coming over to sit heavily
down on the bench by David’s side. Then
she whipped the shawl-ends over across her
lap and stared first at the little shoemaker and
then at Davie.</p>

<p>“We was,” said Mr. Beebe, “us two: we
made quite a nice party; just big enough.”</p>

<p>“Who is the boy?” Mrs. Goodsell turned
her heavy body as far as she could and stared
worse than ever at Davie.</p>

<p>“That is David Pepper sitting on the
bench,” said Mr. Beebe. “Now what kind
o’ shoes do you want, Mis Goodsell? You
can be tellin’ me, an’ then I’ll be ready to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span>
’em when I’m through with this piece o’
work.”</p>

<p>“I d’no’s I want any shoes,” said the big
woman, “I thought I’d drop in an’ see what
you’d got.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the little shoemaker, “my
business is to show folks who want shoes, not
to show ’em shoes ef they don’t want any.”</p>

<p>“But I may want ’em ef you’ve got some I
like,” said Mrs. Goodsell tartly.</p>

<p>As Mr. Beebe said nothing to this, but kept
on with his cobbling, Mrs. Goodsell concentrated
her attention on the small boy by her
side.</p>

<p>“Who’s your folks?” she demanded. She
had faded greenish eyes, and Davie could
think of nothing but gooseberries. He tried
not to look at them, and at last turned such a
helpless glance on the little shoemaker, that
Mr. Beebe came to the rescue. He had opened
his mouth to ask, “And how is your folks,
Mis Goodsell?” when an organ grinder suddenly
struck up a tune just outside the shop
door.</p>

<p>Davie sprang from the bench and hopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span>
close to the little old man still cobbling away.</p>

<p>“Oh, I must go,” he cried. “Do give me
my shoe, Mr. Beebe,” holding out a frantic
hand.</p>

<p>“There, there, Davie,” said the little shoemaker,
“you wait a minute, an’ I’ll have your
shoe done.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it done enough?” said Davie, all in
a tremble, “please, dear Mr. Beebe, let me
go!”</p>

<p>“What’s th’ matter with th’ boy?” cried
Mrs. Goodsell, “I never see anybody act so.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you fret yourself, Mis Goodsell,”
said Mr. Beebe, “I’ll take care o’ Davie. You
set an’ be comf’table.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t be comf’table—who could
be, seein’ him carryin’ on so?” said the big
woman.</p>

<p>Mr. Beebe, not hearing her, for he was now
divided over his attempts to soothe Davie, and
to see the little shoe repaired as it should be,
bent his gray head to hear Davie, who was by
this time in a frenzy to get home, and as he
kept saying, “be with Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“So you shall, Davie, in a minute or two,
an’ don’t you worry, th’ organ man can’t get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span>
by your house in a long while with that thing
on his back. And mebbe he ain’t goin’ that
way at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he will—he will!” cried Davie, in
his terror guilty of contradicting, and he beat
his hands together and hopped from one foot
to the other in his distress.</p>

<p>Suddenly the organ man stopped the tune,
and twitched a chain that rattled on the cobble-stones.
Up ran a monkey, and as the man
slung the organ on his back, the monkey followed
to perch himself there, pull off his cap
and bow to a baker’s boy and a small girl with
a paper bag of groceries, both hanging on his
every movement with wide open mouth and
eyes.</p>

<p>Davie saw all this, as he plunged over to
the small-paned window, when the tune
stopped, and peered out between the rows of
shoes and slippers that were strung across it.</p>

<p>“He’s going!” he gave a sharp little cry.
Hearing this, and seeing his face, little Mr.
Beebe stopped his work nearly as suddenly as
the tune. “There now, I’ll put on your shoe.
’Tain’t done as good as I want to, you tell your
Ma, an’ ef you come over to-morrow, I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span>
finish th’ job up good an’ splendid.” He was
saying all this as he tied the shoe on Davie’s
small foot. “An’ don’t you worry a mite.”</p>

<p>Davie, only waiting till the string was tied,
shot out and over the big flat door-stone to
the cobble-stones of the narrow street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>THE STORY IN THE SHOE-SHOP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“MY! How he acts!” exclaimed Mrs.
Goodsell, nervously drawing her
shawl-ends closer over her lap. “Who is that
boy, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s David Pepper,” said the little
shoemaker.</p>

<p>“David who?”</p>

<p>Mr. Beebe was craning his short neck to
see through the small-paned window what
progress David was making over the cobble-stones,
and he didn’t pay much attention to
the big woman sitting on the bench. So she
got clumsily up to her feet and came over to
him.</p>

<p>“Who’d you say that boy was?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Pepper—David Pepper, I told you,” said
little Mr. Beebe, turning away from the
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span>“You said David—I didn’t catch the last
name.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s Pepper.”</p>

<p>“Pepper? Well, that’s a funny name.
Who be his folks?”</p>

<p>“Now, Mis’ Goodsell,” exclaimed the little
shoemaker in exasperation, standing quite still
to regard her, “do you mean to say that you
don’t know Mis’ Pepper? I thought all Badgertown
knew her.”</p>

<p>“Well, my fam’ly ain’t Badgertown folks,
you must remember,” said Mrs. Goodsell, getting
back to the bench, and flapping the shawl-ends
again across her lap, “an’ I don’t get
over from Four Corners only once in a dog’s
age. How am I to know your Pepperses, pray
tell?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve missed gettin’ acquainted
with an awful nice woman,” observed Mr.
Beebe. “I tell you, we set by her in Badgertown,
her an’ her childern.”</p>

<p>“Well, ef they’re as queer as that young
one,” Mrs. Goodsell indicated with her large
hand the departed small boy, “I guess I
hain’t anythin’ to cry over ’cause we ain’t more
acquainted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span>“Ef you mean ’cause David got scared an’
run off,” the little shoemaker stopped half
across the shop on his way to begin a cobbling
job, and faced her with a gleaming eye, “I
can tell you why. ’Twas enough to make him
run, I says, says I.”</p>

<p>“What was?” the big woman hitched forward
on the bench. It was worth coming in
from “Four Corners”—a journey she detested,
to hear the little shoemaker go on like
this, for generally he only passed the time of
day, and then got down to the business of
selling shoes.</p>

<p>“Why, when he heard that organ man
strike up so suddint.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodsell turned and stared at the
small-paned window, in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>“I don’t see nothin’ to that,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, but there was a monkey.”</p>

<p>“S’posin’ there was—there warn’t nothin’
to that, neither.”</p>

<p>“Well, it might ’a’ ben like th’ other monkey—mebbe
’twas th’ same one!” the little shoemaker
slapped his fat thigh, “I wouldn’t wonder;
an’ David guessed it.”</p>

<p>“Ef you could stop talkin’ about your monkeys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span>
an’ begin again, mebbe I c’d make head
or tail o’ what you’re tryin’ to tell me, Mr.
Beebe,” cried the big woman in irritation.</p>

<p>Little Mr. Beebe kept slapping his thigh, and
declaring, “I do b’lieve Davie guessed it,”
then he suddenly waddled over to the corner,
got out a box of dilapidated shoes, picked out
a pair, and sat down to work, “Yes, I verily
b’lieve he guessed it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodsell heaved a long sigh. It was
no use to ask him to begin, for she knew he
wouldn’t do it till he was ready—so she
folded her large hands over the shawl-ends.</p>

<p>“You see,” said little Mr. Beebe, holding
up a man’s shoe to thumb it critically, “it’s
just this way, about David—O dear me! it
beats all how th’ parson does wear out his
shoes. I’m afraid that’s too far gone to
mend.”</p>

<p>He set the minister’s shoe on his lap and
regarded it mournfully.</p>

<p>“I guess I must be goin’,” Mrs. Goodsell
made as if her mind were on “Four Corners.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” cried the little shoemaker, tearing
off his gaze from the parson’s footgear,
“I must tell you about Davie, for you ain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span>
a-goin’ away until you understand about th’
boy. You see, th’ littlest of th’ Pepper childern
is a girl, an’ she ain’t much more’n a
baby. You ought to see her!” He pushed
up his spectacles and beamed at her.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” interrupted Mrs. Goodsell,
“I know about babies. Had plenty o’ my
own. Go on, Mr. Beebe.”</p>

<p>“Well,” the little shoemaker swallowed his
disappointment at being held up in his description
of Phronsie, “everybody in the little
brown house looks out for everybody else.
That’s th’ way they do; an’ although Mis’
Pepper is a hard-workin’ woman, it just beats
all how pleasant they keep. You never’d
know to look at ’em how they scrimp an’
pinch.”</p>

<p>The big woman unfolded her hands from
the shawl-ends, and slowly regarded them.
But she said nothing, and Mr. Beebe went on.</p>

<p>“Yes, they just hang together, an’ look out
for each other.”</p>

<p>“I warrant so,” exclaimed Mrs. Goodsell
with a sniff, “an’ do nothin’ for nobody else.”</p>

<p>“There’s where you’re wrong.” Little old
Mr. Beebe fairly snapped it out. “Ef there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span>
a fam’ly in Badgertown that does more for
other folks, I hain’t, so far, heerd th’ name.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said they was obleeged to
scrimp,” said Mrs. Goodsell.</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with it?” The little
shoemaker brought this out with such a roar
that old Mrs. Beebe threw open the door into
the shop. She was just mixing bread, and
her sleeves were rolled up, and little flour dabs
had flown up as far as her cap.</p>

<p>“Mercy me, Pa. I thought you was sick!”
she exclaimed. “Oh, how do you do, Mis’
Goodsell.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t sick, Ma,” replied the little shoemaker,
turning his round red face to her, “but
I shall be unless you come in an’ ’xplain things
about th’ Peppers.”</p>

<p>“What about th’ Peppers? There hain’t
nothin’ happened to ’em!” cried Mrs. Beebe in
alarm, and trotting in.</p>

<p>“My land, no!” declared the little shoemaker.
“I wouldn’t be a-settin’ here so ca’m-like,
ef any trouble had ’a’ come to them, Ma.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if they’re all right, I’ll come back
as soon as I’ve mixed my bread,” and Mrs.
Beebe trotted out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span>Little Mr. Beebe began to work briskly on
the minister’s shoe. As long as Ma was coming
back, it wouldn’t pay to get flustered.
Meantime the big woman plied him with questions
till she had a pretty fair idea of the little-brown-house
people, and all their ages and
names.</p>

<p>Then she drew out her big hands again from
the shawl-ends and held them up, “They’ll tell
the story. I’ve worked some in my life,” she
said, “an’ I never got no time to do for other
folks.”</p>

<p>“Prob’ly not,” said the little shoemaker
drily. “Well, here’s Ma,” and he drew a long
breath of relief.</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Beebe had put on a fresh cap,
and was now tying the strings of a clean white
apron around her ample waist, as befitted sitting
down in the shop.</p>

<p>“Tell about how Phronsie run off after th’
monkey,” said Mr. Beebe.</p>

<p>“That always makes me feel bad whenever
I tell it,” said Mrs. Beebe, with a sigh, “’cause
it brings back what a dretful thing it was.
Why, we thought we’d lost her!” She leaned
forward suddenly in her chair, and the color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span>
in her cheek like that of a winter apple, seemed
suddenly to fade.</p>

<p>“You!” exclaimed Mrs. Goodsell, in astonishment.
“Why, she warn’t noways related.
Why did you take on about it, pray tell?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand,” began Mrs. Beebe.</p>

<p>“No, she don’t,” declared the little shoemaker
irritably, “and what’s more, she won’t,
ef you sh’d set there till the day o’ judgment.”</p>

<p>“But she <i>must</i>,” Mrs. Beebe pointed off her
words with the fingers of one pudgy hand
marking them off on the palm of the other,
“We all—everybody in Badgertown sets a
sight by those Pepper childern, an’ Phronsie—well
there,” she lifted up a corner of her
apron and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” said Mrs. Goodsell.</p>

<p>“An’ one day, we don’t ’xactly know how,
Phronsie followed an organ grinder—he had
a monkey an’ he stopped an’ played in th’ Peppers’
yard—th’ little brown house, you
know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodsell nodded. “Yes, go on.”</p>

<p>“An’ when he went down th’ road,
Phronsie went after him. Polly had hurried
back to work, an’ Mis Pepper was down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span>
the parson’s helpin’ Mis Henderson, an’ the
boys was a workin’.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me, they was mighty little childern
for all of ’em to be workin’,” broke in
Mrs. Goodsell, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Th’ Peppers warn’t never too little to
work,” the little shoemaker said quickly.
“They was up an’ at it, I tell you, ’nstead o’
playin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” said Mrs. Goodsell.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t, hardly,” gasped little Mrs.
Beebe, clasping her fat hands, “it brings it all
back. You see, she—she didn’t come back,
an’ then we all knew she was lost.” With that,
Mrs. Beebe threw her apron over her head
and burst out crying.</p>

<p>The little shoemaker deserted the parson’s
shoe, and skipped over to her. “There, there,
Ma,” he patted her cap with a soothing hand.
“You know she didn’t stay lost. We got her
back.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think you’re th’ queerest folks,”
exclaimed Mrs. Goodsell, “to carry on so over
somethin’ that never happened, an’ besides
’twarn’t to your folks, neither.”</p>

<p>“’<i>Twas</i> our folks, I keep tellin’ you.” Little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span>
Mrs. Beebe brought her flushed face out
from the apron and wiped off the tears.
“They <i>was</i> ‘our folks’ to all Badgertown.
An’ ef Phronsie had ’a’—” and her mouth
trembled.</p>

<p>“You see,” the little shoemaker hastened to
say, “we was all a-lookin’ through th’ whole
o’ Badgertown for her—an’ then to think
’twas an out-of-town one who found her, after
all.”</p>

<p>“Who?” cried the big woman.</p>

<p>“A boy, an’ he didn’t live in these parts,
neither—him an’ his big black dog got her
away from th’ organ grinder an’ th’ monkey.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“Yes,—now you tell th’ rest, Ma.” The
little shoemaker ambled back to his work, and
picked up the parson’s shoe again.</p>

<p>“Well, that boy was stayin’ over to Hingham,”
explained Mrs. Beebe, pointing with her
fat finger.</p>

<p>“Hingham don’t lay in that direction,” said
Mrs. Goodsell critically, “it’s over there,” and
she waved her big hand to the opposite corner
of the shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span>“Never mind,” said Mrs. Beebe easily, “I
ain’t partic’lar about Hingham now. I’m
tellin’ about th’ boy, he was stayin’ there with
his father.”</p>

<p>“Who was his father?” Mrs. Goodsell
was for getting all the particulars, if she got
any.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was an awful big man. I guess he
was born big,” and Mrs. Beebe shuddered.
“I hain’t seen him but twice. An’ then Badgertown
seemed so little when he was drivin’
by, I was afraid he couldn’t get through. But
the boy—” here a smile ran up Mrs. Beebe’s
round face—“you never’d know from him
that he was rich.”</p>

<p>“Was he rich?” asked Mrs. Goodsell in an
awed tone.</p>

<p>“<i>Rich?</i>” the little shoemaker’s wife
brought it out almost in a scream, “why he
could buy us all up, an’ you Four Corners
folks, an’ everywhere’s around for miles and
miles.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!”</p>

<p>“But th’ boy—why, he’d come over an’
play with th’ Pepper childern ev’ry chance he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[452]</span>
got. You see th’ father didn’t care about
havin’ young folks round, so Jasper got
lonely.”</p>

<p>“Jasper?” interrupted the big woman.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was th’ boy’s name—Jasper
King.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“He got lonely, I was sayin’, with nobody
but his big dog for comp’ny, so over he’d come
to Badgertown. You just ought to hear what
times they had in th’ little brown house.”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Beebe laughed. The little shoemaker
laid down his work, and joined, both
of them shaking their fat sides at the remembrance.</p>

<p>“I’ve heerd Polly tell about them times—I
tell you, she’s the one to set off a story good,”
chuckled old Mr. Beebe, “ain’t she now, Ma?”</p>

<p>“You’d ought to have seen ’em as I seen
’em—Pa an’ me both did,” said the shoemaker’s
wife, “that boy with one o’ Mis Pepper’s
big check apuns on tied around his neck,
an’ rollin’ out bits o’ dough—an’ then stickin’
’em into th’ old stove. That was before Dr.
Fisher give ’em th’ new stove—an’ him as
rich as Crocus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span>“Dr. Fisher rich!” cried Mrs. Goodsell,
raising both hands. “Why, he’s as poor as
Job’s turkey, an’ with them two old-maid sisters
on his hands. Now I know you’ve ben
stuffin’ me right along, Mis Beebe,” she added,
in an injured tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean Dr. Fisher was rich,
I said th’ boy,” cried Mrs. Beebe, in a loud
voice.</p>

<p>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“An’ then, he had to go—th’ boy did, for
his father went back home, an’—”</p>

<p>“You hain’t told about th’ gingerbread boy,
Ma,” old Mr. Beebe began to laugh again.</p>

<p>“That was th’ funniest of all,” said Mrs.
Beebe, and she began to laugh, too.</p>

<p>“What was it?” cried the big woman impatiently.
“You do so much laughin’, you an’
Mr. Beebe, it’s kinder slow work gettin’
along.”</p>

<p>“I know it, an’ you must ’xcuse me, Mis
Goodsell,” said Mrs. Beebe, “but them childern—well,
you see Phronsie always takes
it to heart when she hears anybody’s sick, so
she made a gingerbread boy an’ made ’em send
it to Jasper’s father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span>“My goodness!—to a rich man—a gingerbread
boy!” gasped Mrs. Goodsell.</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ you’d ’a’ thought ’twould ’a’
made him mad,” said Mrs. Beebe.</p>

<p>“Well, it did, didn’t it?” said Mrs. Goodsell,
“a <i>gingerbread</i> boy!”</p>

<p>“Mad? Why, he just took to that gingerbread
boy like a duck to water! An’ he come
over to see Phronsie. An’ now you can’t
think, they’re a-writin’ back an’ forth, Jasper
an’ th’ childern.”</p>

<p>“Polly gits th’ letters,” said old Mr. Beebe.</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ they hope he’s comin’, an’ th’
father, over to Hingham again this summer,”
said Mrs. Beebe. “Well, I could tell lots
more, but I sha’n’t, ’cause I’ve got to get back
an’ git on my other apun an’ red up my
kitchen,” and she waddled off.</p>

<p>“It’s th’ most remarkable story <i>I</i> ever
heerd,” said Mrs. Goodsell, getting off from
the bench, seeing there was no more to be
gained.</p>

<p>“So you see why David Pepper run so like
lightnin’,” cried old Mr. Beebe, “he was
afraid th’ organ man was goin’ down by th’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span>
little brown house, an’ he wanted to get home
an’ see that Phronsie didn’t get took off.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t blame him,” said Mrs. Goodsell,
with a nod from her large head, “an’ I
don’t myself much like organ-grinders
snoopin’ round. Why, there he is now—an’
th’ monkey’s comin’ in th’ door!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>THE LETTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE little wrinkled face of a monkey appeared,
dragging a chain at the end of
which came his master. He had set the organ
up against the little shop.</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodsell, not knowing how she got
there, was standing on the bench, her calico
gown whipped tightly around her, the shawl-ends
wound over that, and screaming loudly.
Old Mrs. Beebe hurried in with both hands
raised, while the little shoemaker, trying to
drive out both the monkey and the man, didn’t
succeed in doing either, but got tangled up
with the chain.</p>

<p>“Pa—Pa, let him go!” cried Mrs. Beebe,
wringing her hands. “I’ll get th’ broom,”
disappearing to come back with it, when she
found things in a much worse state. For the
monkey, shaking the chain free from both the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[457]</span>
little shoemaker and his master, was now on
the upper shelf in the row that occupied one
side of the shop, twitching off the covers of
the boxes, and throwing down the shoes and
rubbers and slippers in a heap to the floor.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this confusion, David
Pepper opened the door.</p>

<p>“O my senses!” screamed Mrs. Goodsell
from the bench, where she was constantly hopping
from one foot to the other in terrified
distress, “here’s that boy again—ah—<i>oof</i>!”
as the monkey stopped his work a second to
fasten his little eyes on her.</p>

<p>Davie quickly closed the door and stood on
the big flat stone, his heart beating wildly.
Then he opened it again. “I’ll help you,” he
said, going in.</p>

<p>“Davie, he’ll bite you!” screamed old Mrs.
Beebe, waving her broom.</p>

<p>Davie shut his eyes, as he thought so, too.
Then he opened them and began to climb the
lowest shelf to reach the end of the dangling
chain. The monkey stopped regarding the
screaming woman on the bench, whom he had
almost made up his mind he would leap for,
and peered over at the boy, and as quick as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[458]</span>
lightning, he twitched up the chain and grinned
in Davie’s face.</p>

<p>“Now, you’ve done it,” exclaimed the organ
man, with a word that wasn’t pretty at all,
and he glared at Davie.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Davie, sliding to
the floor. His face was very red, and his blue
eyes went down in shame.</p>

<p>“Don’t feel bad,” old Mr. Beebe gasped out
the words, and leaned, quite spent, against the
counter where he did up his bundles for customers.</p>

<p>“Get something to eat,” the organ man
growled it out at the shoemaker’s wife, “then
he’ll come down and I’ll lick him ’most to
death.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t,” cried Davie, forgetting
his shame to rush over to the organ man.</p>

<p>“Mustn’t, hey? You stand out of th’ way,
you beggar-boy, you,” looking down contemptuously
at Davie’s little patched shoes,
and he pushed him roughly off.</p>

<p>“You let that boy alone,” commanded old
Mr. Beebe, puffing up. The man laughed in
the fat little shoemaker’s face. “Get somethin’
to eat, I tell you,” he roared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span>“Oh, I will—I will,” old Mrs. Beebe
trotted off, and came back with two doughnuts
in her trembling hands.</p>

<p>“You hold ’em up,” said the organ man.
“He won’t come down for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t,” Mrs. Beebe shook all over.</p>

<p>“Let th’ boy hold ’em,” said the man; “he
butted in there an’ lost us th’ chain, and now
he can git him down.”</p>

<p>David cast a wild look up at the little beast,
whose sharp eyes were roving from his master
to the small boy that had interfered with the
chain.</p>

<p>“No, no, Davie,” began the little shoemaker—but
intent only on the organ man’s
charge that he was to blame, Davie took the
doughnuts out of old Mrs. Beebe’s hands, before
she realized it.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t whip him,” he said, looking
back at the man, before he held them up.</p>

<p>But he didn’t need to, for there was a sudden
leap from the high shelf, the end of the
chain rattled off, and the monkey came down
on Davie’s little shoulder, knocking him to
the floor in among the shoes and slippers and
rubbers scattered about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span>They never knew quite how it all ended,
but when Davie picked himself up, the organ
man was dragging the monkey, swallowing
the last piece of the second doughnut, out of
the shop.</p>

<p>“He mustn’t whip him,” cried Davie, gasping
from his fright, and darting after.</p>

<p>“You come back,” commanded the little
shoemaker. “See!” and David having nothing
to do but to obey, he was led over to look
out of the window. There was the monkey
perched on the organ slung on the back of the
man, who was getting over the cobble-stones
at a lively rate. “Now you can help me to
pick up these,” added old Mr. Beebe, pointing
to the havoc made in his merchandise sprawled
over the floor.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Beebe had sunk down in a chair,
and clasped her hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” cried Davie, springing to
the work, yet with a heavy heart as he thought
of the monkey.</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodsell stood quite still on the bench,
her surprise not allowing her to take her eyes
off from Davie. Now she peered down at
him, gathering up the shoes, rubbers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[461]</span>
slippers. “I thought you was scared of
monkeys,” she said slowly. Then she put one
large foot down and began to descend to the
floor.</p>

<p>“Did you go home, Davie?” asked the
little shoemaker quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Davie, handing him two or
three rubbers; “I did, and Mamsie sent me
back to ask you to please finish mending my
shoe.”</p>

<p>“So I will,” said old Mr. Beebe, “as soon as
we get these things gathered up. Your Ma
will look after Phronsie, I s’pose she told
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Davie, “she did.”</p>

<p>“Well now, I’m glad you went home an’
told your ma there was an organ man in
Badgertown ’cause there ain’t no Jasper here
now, with his big dog. Heard anythin’ from
him lately?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Davie, “Mr. Atkins gave
Mamsie a letter yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Sho now!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, much
gratified. He ached to ask what was in it, but
for all the world he couldn’t bring himself to
such a thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[462]</span>“What did the letter say?” demanded Mrs.
Goodsell.</p>

<p>Davie turned his blue eyes up to her. “It
was Mamsie’s letter,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I heerd you. Well, what did it
<i>say</i>? I ain’t cur’ous, but I jest thought I’d
ask. Hey?”</p>

<p>But she got no answer, David being busy
handing the shoes, slippers, and rubbers up to
old Mr. Beebe’s waiting hands.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the impident boys I ever see!”
exclaimed Mrs. Goodsell, slapping the shawl-ends
indignantly around her big figure, “you
beat ’em all!”</p>

<p>“There—there—” declared the little
shoemaker, straightening up, “my shop ain’t
big enough to hold folks who talk against th’
Peppers. So, good mornin’ to you, Mis Goodsell.”</p>

<p>“An’ I shake th’ dust off from my feet,”
cried Mrs. Goodsell, shaking her shawl-ends
instead, “an’ I wouldn’t demean myself by
stayin’, Mr. Beebe,—what with your Pepperses
an’ monkeys an’ letters.” She slammed
the door, and disdaining the flat stone, strode
over the cobble-stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[463]</span>Davie, to whom her words brought a memory
he was trying to put in the background,
sighed.</p>

<p>“Now you’re gettin’ all tired out,” said Mrs.
Beebe, in a worried way. “Don’t let him
work any more, Pa.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I’m not tired,” said Davie, raising
his flushed face. “I want to put all the things
back. Do let me, Mr. Beebe,” he begged.
He longed to say that it was old Mr. King’s
letter to Mamsie that was bothering him.
But that belonged to Mamsie.</p>

<p>How could they ever let Polly go from the
little brown house to visit in the city! Mamsie
had written “No” twice before to Mr.
King; but yesterday after reading this particular
letter, Mother Pepper had looked very
sober. “She must think about it,” she had
told the children. Think about it! Davie
didn’t imagine that it needed a second thought.
They couldn’t let Polly go! even if Jasper was
sick, and the doctor said there must be some
little friend invited to cheer things up. Oh,
no, they couldn’t!</p>

<p>When the shoes and rubbers and slippers
were all neatly put back in their respective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[464]</span>
boxes, and on the shelf once more, old Mrs.
Beebe, who had gone off into the kitchen, came
back with a blue plate on which were two
doughnuts. “Now while Pa is a-mendin’
your shoe, you can set an’ eat ’em,” she said.</p>

<p>Davie, well pleased, curled up on the bench
and munched the sugary things slowly to
make them last. He wanted to ask if he
couldn’t take one home for Phronsie, but then
that was as good as begging one—for old
Mrs. Beebe would trot out to her big stone
pot, and get him another. So he watched his
shoe having the finishing touches put to its repairs,
while he ate.</p>

<p>“Now says I,” the little shoemaker held up
the completed work, as David swallowed the
last crumb of the doughnuts, “that job is done
as good as th’ next one, if I do say it. Now,
Davie, that will last you a long spell.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad.” Davie hopped off from
the bench, and sitting down on the floor, he
pulled on the shoe with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>“That string ain’t very strong,” said Mr.
Beebe, “I guess I better get you another.”
He went across the shop and pulled out a
drawer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[465]</span>Davie stopped trying to tie the shoestring.
“Mamsie didn’t say that I was to get a new
string,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, you ain’t goin’ to buy this,” said old
Mr. Beebe, coming back. “I’m goin’ to give
it to you. Give me the shoe, Davie, and we’ll
see about that string.”</p>

<p>So Davie pulled off his shoe, and old Mr.
Beebe sat down and pretty soon there was a
brand-new shoestring in it, and the old one
lay on the floor.</p>

<p>“I think th’ mate to that string is pretty
poor,” said the little old shoemaker, peering at
Davie’s other foot critically; “give me that
shoe, Davie,” and when it was in his hand, he
pulled out the shoestring. “Yes, it’s wore in
spots,” he declared.</p>

<p>At last Davie was on his way home.
Didn’t the shoes feel good though; the mended
one all strong and just as good as ever, and
with new shoestrings, too! He wanted to
dance—but stopped suddenly. There was
Polly—was she going away for a visit to the
city? He went slowly up the path leading to
the little brown house, and opened the green
door. There were Mamsie and the others, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[466]</span>
David knew by her face what she was going
to say.</p>

<p>“Children,” she began, “you know how
good Jasper has been to us! And think of
Phronsie!” She gathered her up in her arms
to hold her tightly to her breast, and her voice
broke. “What can we ever do for him!”</p>

<p>“But, Mamsie,” began Ben, “Polly—we
can’t—” He couldn’t get any farther, and
his head went down to hide his face on his
knees.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not going!” cried Polly passionately,
a little red spot coming on either cheek.
“You needn’t think of it, Ben,” and she threw
her arms around his shoulders—while Joel
roared, “She isn’t going—she isn’t!” and he
ran over to throw his arms across Polly’s—till
Ben was nearly smothered. David longed
to add himself to them, and he started, but
catching Mother Pepper’s eye, he settled back
and held his hands tightly together in dread
of what was coming, for Mrs. Pepper was
speaking.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Polly,” she said reprovingly.
“You must think, child, before you
speak.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[467]</span>“Oh, I don’t want to think, Mamsie!” cried
Polly, wildly, and deserting Ben, she plunged
over to Mrs. Pepper’s chair and threw herself
on her knees. “Mamsie, don’t make me go!”
she begged, burying her face on Phronsie’s
small feet.</p>

<p>“I never should <i>make</i> you go, Polly,” Mrs.
Pepper stroked the brown hair. “Mother
feels badly enough to think of your going. It
must be as you say, Polly.”</p>

<p>So there it was left. And every now and
then Polly would break away from whatever
she was doing, even if setting the supper-table,
and rush up in a torrent of tears. “Oh, I
can’t go—Mamsie, I <i>can’t</i>!” And then she
would fly back to her work to creep up presently
with “Jasper saved Phronsie for us,
Mamsie!”</p>

<p>“I know, Polly,” Mother Pepper would say
softly, and Polly would know that all Mamsie’s
objections to the visit had not only flown
away, but that instead, there would be an approval
of it if Polly should decide to go.</p>

<p>“Now, children,” after the supper dishes
were cleared away, and everything was “spick
and span” again, and Mother Pepper had sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[468]</span>
down to get a little more of the waning light
to sew by before the evening really set in, “I
think,” she said, “you better have that day in
the woods to-morrow, for you have been waiting
for it so long.”</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” cried Davie, looking up at his
mother with shining eyes, “can we <i>really</i> go to
the woods to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“I think so, Davie.” Mrs. Pepper smiled
at him. “Don’t scream so, Joel. Yes, you
may all go to-morrow.” She looked around
for Polly—who had drawn off in a corner
with Ben, their heads together and filled with
sad thoughts, as she very well knew. The day
in the woods was the only thing she could
plan by which she might divert the sadness, at
least for a time.</p>

<p>“Mamsie,” Davie crowded up to her chair,
“can we stay when we get there in the woods—can
we?” he asked, dreadfully excited.</p>

<p>“Yes indeed—a whole long day if you
want to,” said Mother Pepper decidedly.
“Now run over and tell Polly and Ben how
glad you are about it.”</p>

<p>“And can we carry things to eat?” demanded
Joel, precipitating himself upon her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[469]</span>
his black eyes waiting impatiently for her answer.</p>

<p>“Of course, you can take your dinner,” and
Mother Pepper laughed. “Who ever heard
of spending a day in the woods without anything
to eat! And I expect you’ll be very
hungry, Joel.”</p>

<p>“I’m hungry now,” said Joel reflectively.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joey—you’ve only just finished your
supper,” said Mrs. Pepper. At his words, she
began to sew away brisker than ever.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t half enough,” said Joel,
looking over his shoulder at the cleared table
set up against the wall. “Why isn’t there
ever any more to eat, Mamsie?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Mrs. Pepper, stitching
fast. “Well, now, to-morrow you shall have
a good deal. You will like the basket I shall
pack for you,” she added cheerily.</p>

<p>“What’s to be in it?” cried Joel, smacking
his lips, “candy, and a pie?”</p>

<p>“O dear me! Joe—not those things,” said
Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“Then some cake,” said Joel, hanging over
her knee, so that his small elbows dragged her
work down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[470]</span>“No indeed,” she slipped the sewing away,
but let the elbows remain, “cake isn’t the best
thing for children to eat in the woods. But,
Joel, just think, Mother is going to give you
some nice thick slices of bread and—butter.”</p>

<p>“Not butter?” cried Joel, quite overcome.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mrs. Pepper nodded.</p>

<p>“And spread it thick, do, Mamsie,” cried
Joel, dreadfully excited, “as thick as that.”
He took off his elbows to put his little brown
hands a good distance apart.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper laughed. “You never would
relish butter again if you had it as thick as
that, Joey,” she said. “Now run over and tell
Ben and Polly all about it.”</p>

<p>Her work fell down for a minute, as he
dashed off—and a shadow swept across her
face; but it was gone as quickly, and the
needle flew all the faster.</p>

<p>Joel rushed up to the two in the corner.
“We are going to have butter to-morrow, Polly
Pepper,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Ben, pulling himself
out of his gloom. “You’ve been dreaming,
Joe.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t, either,” retorted Joel indignantly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[471]</span>
“Mamsie said so.” He darted
across the kitchen. “Didn’t you, Mamsie?”
he cried, plunging up to her chair. “Ben says
I’ve been dreaming.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I do what, Joel?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you say you were going to give us
butter to-morrow to eat in the woods?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did, Joey,” said Mrs. Pepper.
She looked over his head and nodded to the
three in the corner. “Come over here, children.
Wait a minute; Phronsie.”</p>

<p>Phronsie, who had been undressing Seraphina
for bed, always a slow process, laid the
rag doll on a chair, and came up wonderingly
to her mother’s knee.</p>

<p>“Now it’s just this way,” began Mrs. Pepper,
looking at them all, “to-morrow must be
the very happiest day of the whole year. And
in order to get ready for it and make it happy—why,
we must all begin to-night. Now,
Joel and Davie, you’d better run off to bed, so
that you can hop up bright and early in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” Joel grumbled. But seeing
his mother’s face, he finished, “All right—come
on, Dave.” Then he ran back when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[472]</span>
half-way up the loft stairs. “Please spread
it thick, Mamsie,” he begged.</p>

<p>“Come, Phronsie,” Polly held out her hand.
She tried to make the sad little smile a brighter
one, but it was a sorrowful face, after all, that
she carried off.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” cried Phronsie, in distress.
“My child hasn’t her nightie on,” and she ran
back to the chair where Seraphina waited to
be gotten ready for bed.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” said Polly, “for you must
get into your own nightie. There, you run
back and kiss Mamsie, and I’ll get Seraphina
ready.”</p>

<p>So Phronsie, well pleased to be cuddled by
Mamsie, ran back and scrambled into Mother
Pepper’s lap.</p>

<p>“Be a good girl, Phronsie, and don’t trouble
Polly, but hop right into bed,” said Mrs. Pepper.</p>

<p>“I’ll be a good girl,” cooed Phronsie, her
lips against Mother Pepper’s neck. Then she
slid off from Mamsie’s lap, and was soon fast
asleep in the trundle-bed, Seraphina huddled
up in her arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[473]</span>And Polly, down on her knees by the big old
bed, her head on the gay patchwork quilt, was
saying, “I’ll go.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br>

<small>WORKING HARD TO KEEP CHEERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PARSON HENDERSON walked slowly
between the hollyhocks, his hands folded
behind his back. His wife hurried down the
narrow path to join him.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said breathlessly, “we are all
going to feel dreadfully when Polly has really
gone.”</p>

<p>“We mustn’t think of ourselves,” said the
parson. “Poor Mrs. Pepper!” and he sighed.</p>

<p>“I know it, and yet you did right to advise
her to let Polly go,” Mrs. Henderson peered
anxiously up into his face.</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit sorry that I did so advise,”
declared Parson Henderson firmly. “Almira,
it is a clear case of the working of Providence
for that girl to have the chance.” He stopped
short on the garden path.</p>

<p>“I know it,” cried his wife gleefully, “think
of the music! Oh, Adoniram, how Polly has
longed for a chance to learn to play.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[475]</span>She clasped her hands and the smile ran up
to capture the anxiety in her face.</p>

<p>“I do think. I think of all the good that
will come of the visit.” The parson began his
walk once more, this time with a stride. Mrs.
Henderson trotted by his side, trying to keep
up with him.</p>

<p>“Don’t go so fast, husband,” she begged.</p>

<p>“Yes,” as he slackened his pace, “and another
thing. We ought to consider how much
the Peppers are indebted to Jasper. If it
hadn’t been for him—just think.” She ran
her hand within his arm.</p>

<p>“That’s the reason I was able to persuade
Mrs. Pepper to let Polly go,” cried Mr. Henderson.
“She put aside everything else, when
she saw that she could do this for the boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes. Oh, I’m so glad. But, O
dear,” she couldn’t for the life of her keep
from adding, “those children—can you
imagine what they are going to do without
Polly!”</p>

<p>The parson’s face fell gloomily.</p>

<p>“There’s Ben,—it will come desperately
hard on him,” he said.</p>

<p>“Ben will make up his mind to bear it—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[476]</span>
is the oldest—and he is such a strong boy,”
said Mrs. Henderson quickly. “The one I
am worrying about the most is Davie.”</p>

<p>“Poor Davie will take it pretty hard, I am
afraid.”</p>

<p>“And he will keep it all in on account of
Mrs. Pepper, and it will wear on him terribly.
O dear me!” Mrs. Henderson now looked so
very miserable that her husband lost thought
of the Peppers and turned to comfort her.</p>

<p>“See here, Almira,” he cried, “we are acting
badly, both of us. What sort of example,
pray tell, are we to the little-brown-house people.
We’ve simply got to cheer up.”</p>

<p>“So I will,” cried his wife, trying to smile;
“I’m ashamed of myself. And now that
Polly is really going, I mustn’t stay here talking
any longer, when I could help to get her
ready. There’s that old brown merino dress
of mine; it’s been up in the attic for I don’t
know how long, I shall make it over for her.”
She drew her hand away from his arm and
ran down the path ahead of him. “I’ve a fine
chance to get the pattern of Polly’s calico
gown, now that the children are all away in
the woods to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[477]</span>“The children all away in the woods!” repeated
the parson in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Pepper told me yesterday that
she was going to let them have that treat.
Polly has been wanting it so long. And it
would help to cheer things up. Oh, I am so
glad I took over that little pat of butter. O
dear!” for a sudden turn in the path, and there
was Miss Jerusha, a scowl on her face.</p>

<p>“Of all things on this earth,” she exclaimed,
lifting her long hands, “the silliest is to send
that Pepper girl to the City.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let us talk about it, Jerusha,” said
the parson’s wife, trying to get by.</p>

<p>“Talk about it! It’s time for some one to
talk.” Miss Jerusha’s angular figure successfully
blocked the way. “Such goings on!
Adoniram,” as her brother came up, “what on
earth did you put such a notion into that girl’s
head for! The idea of her going into those
rich folks’ house! She’ll be snubbed to death—that’s
one comfort,” and Miss Jerusha gave
an unpleasant little cackle.</p>

<p>“Polly Pepper will never be snubbed, Jerusha,”
declared the parson decidedly. “On
the contrary—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[478]</span>Miss Jerusha interrupted him, “We’ll see,”
she cried, the cackle becoming a shrill laugh.
Mrs. Henderson stepped off into the grass,
and hurried up into the attic, leaving the parson
to get away as best he could.</p>

<p>And now all Badgertown knew that Polly
Pepper was going to the City on a visit to Mr.
King’s house.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins took down a roll of gingham
from his shelf of dry goods. “I’ll give her
enough for two dresses,” he said. “Land o’
Goshen! she needs somethin’ to help her out.
I wouldn’t be in th’ same house, with that old
Mr. King for a hundred dollars,—no, not by
a long shot.”</p>

<p>And the little shoemaker called Davie in one
day, as he was running by. “You tell Polly
that I’ve got a splendid pair o’ shoes waiting
for her,” and then he turned to old Mrs. Beebe.
“She’ll set by those shoes when she’s in th’
City,” he said complacently, “an’ goes a-walkin’
with Mr. King.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Beebe shuddered again, and said,
“I can’t never imagine her walkin’ with him,
Pa.”</p>

<p>And then one day Mr. Tisbett drove his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[479]</span>
stage up with a great flourish to the little
brown house and Polly’s hair trunk was
strapped on—and she was almost off—when
out she sprang.</p>

<p>“I can’t go!” she cried, “oh, I can’t!” and
dashing between them all, she flew back
through the kitchen to throw herself down in a
torrent of tears by Mamsie’s bed.</p>

<p>No one quite knew how they got her back
again—but the stage at last, with Polly inside,
rolled off, and Mother Pepper and the
four little Peppers went into the little brown
house and shut the green door.</p>

<p>Davie ran as fast as he could, for the first
time in his life not wanting Joel, his mind intent
on reaching the spot where the day in the
woods had been spent. There, under a clump
of oaks on a little mossy bank, were bits of
leaves and flowers, the remains of the wreath
Polly had made to carry home to Mother.
When David saw them, he threw himself down
and buried his face, in an agony of tears. “I
want Polly!” he cried.</p>

<p>A little bird hopped along the branch over
his head to turn a sharp eye down at him. The
sun shone, and he had eaten several worms and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[480]</span>
was perfectly comfortable. What any one
could cry about, he couldn’t understand. For
his part, he felt much more like singing. And
accordingly he did, and such a lively air, all
trills and high notes, as quite astonished himself.
But that only made Davie cry worse, for
it brought back the story that Polly had told
them as they all sat around her while she made
the wreath, of a little bird—why, it must
have been that very one now singing over his
head.</p>

<p>So of course the little bird, very much hurt
in his feelings, at last stopped his song and
flew away. And the wood became quite still.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, a whoop and a shout—and
a boy’s feet came tearing through the bushes,
and between the trees.</p>

<p>“<i>Joel!</i>” gasped David to himself. There
was no time to run, and besides Joel would see
him. The only thing to be done was to burrow
deeper in the mossy bank.</p>

<p>“You ran away,” cried Joel, in great displeasure,
and precipitating himself on him.</p>

<p>David couldn’t very well say he hadn’t, so he
said nothing.</p>

<p>“And it was mean of you,” cried Joel wrathfully,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[481]</span>
and rolling him over to stare into his
face. “Oh—oh—you’ve been crying!”</p>

<p>“Let me alone,” cried David crossly, and
twitching away, he rolled back again. “Go
right home, and let me alone.”</p>

<p>“You ran away,” Joel repeated loudly, so
astounded at such a reception, that all he could
do was to repeat it again, “you ran away.”
This time his round face became very sober—and
in a minute down he went flat on his face
by David’s side.</p>

<p>Davie by this time was quite gone in misery,
and he burst out, “I want Polly!”</p>

<p>Joel didn’t say anything as Davie cried on.
And everything was so still that Davie forgot
that he was there—until a queer little rustle
made him poke up his head. Joel was stuffing
the end of his calico blouse into his mouth and
making frantic efforts to hold back his sobs.
It was now David’s turn to precipitate himself
on Joel.</p>

<p>“I want Polly,” came in gusts from Joel,
and he rolled over and over trying to stop.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, Joel,” begged Davie, very much
frightened.</p>

<p>“I want her,” screamed Joel, “and I’m going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[482]</span>
right straight after her to Mr. King’s house
to bring her home.” With that he hopped to
his feet. His face was dreadfully red, but he
had stopped crying. “They sha’n’t keep her
there,” he declared, and his black eyes flashed
defiantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joel, you wouldn’t do that!” David,
in his terror, gripped Joel’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“I would, too,” declared Joel stoutly. “I
shall start this minute,” and he tore himself
free, and darted down the mossy bank.</p>

<p>David, without stopping to think of the impossibility
of such a plan ever coming to completion,
dashed after him, screaming, “Don’t,
Joel,” with all his might, and catching his foot
in a rambling vine, over he pitched headlong
down a steep descent in the bank.</p>

<p>Joel heard him go, and rushing back to
scramble down after him, he found David picking
himself up from a heap of dried leaves.</p>

<p>“I’m not hurt,” he said.</p>

<p>Joel, who had been shaking with terror, now
laughed till his little white teeth shone.
“They’re all in your hair, Dave,” he said.
“I’ll get ’em out,” pawing the soft light waves,
in which the little dried wisps were sticking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[483]</span>“You won’t tell Mamsie I cried,” said Davie,
looking up anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Joel. Then he stopped
picking the leaves out of the soft hair. “If
you won’t tell her that I did,” he began.</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t—I won’t,” promised David
eagerly, “not a single bit of it, Joel.”</p>

<p>“We both cried, and we both won’t tell,”
decided Joel in a matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p>“And Mamsie will worry if we don’t get
home,” said Davie, “and we mustn’t want
Polly to come back.” He twisted his small
hands together, as he regarded Joel nervously.</p>

<p>“But I do want Polly to come back,” declared
Joel obstinately, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“It will make Mamsie sick.” Davie could
think of nothing better to say, so he repeated it
in a despairing voice, “It will make Mamsie
sick.”</p>

<p>Joel scuffed the heap of dry leaves with his
rusty little shoes—then he blurted out. “I
don’t want my Mamsie to be sick,” he said
slowly.</p>

<p>“Then you won’t go after Polly to bring
her back?” David didn’t dare to breathe, as
he asked it, but hung on Joel’s answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[484]</span>“No,” said Joel magnificently, “she can
stay.”</p>

<p>Times were pretty hard in the little brown
house about these days, and Mother Pepper
had all she could do to have it look as if any
ray of sunshine had ever hopped in. If the
work hadn’t pressed so, it would have been
much worse. But night after night the three
boys dragged themselves up to bed in the loft,
too tired to do anything but tumble on to the
shakedowns and get ready for the next day.
For there was all Polly’s work to do, and as
much of it as they could accomplish to save
Mother was eagerly sought by them all.</p>

<p>And Phronsie, lost to everything but that
Polly was gone, refused to be comforted, and
hung around her mother’s chair, or mourned
for Polly when Mrs. Pepper went down to the
store, or was away to help Mrs. Blodgett.</p>

<p>David, who took upon himself the task of
amusing her, was almost in despair. He had
given up going to help Mr. Atkins in his store
to stay at home and take care of her. He even
tried to tell stories, and racked his brain to
think how Polly would relate one. But he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[485]</span>
couldn’t make any headway in getting her to
stop crying, “I want Polly.”</p>

<p>At last one day Grandma Bascom waddled
in.</p>

<p>“O me—O my!” she exclaimed, sitting
heavily down on the first chair. There sat
Phronsie on the floor, the very picture of woe,
and crying into her pinafore. David was
squatting in front of her, frantically trying to
draw a picture on his slate and explain it by a
story.</p>

<p>Phronsie got up and went over to Grandma’s
chair.</p>

<p>“I want Polly,” she said, the tears trailing
down her little cheeks.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Grandma, who seemed
to understand, even if she couldn’t hear very
well, and patting her yellow hair. “Oh, you
poor creeter, you!” she said to Davie.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t like my stories,” said Davie,
getting up from the floor, his cheeks very much
flushed. He came over and put his mouth close
to Grandma’s cap. “And I can’t tell any good
ones.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Grandma, “that’s because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[486]</span>
she’s heard Polly’s stories. Ef I was you, I
wouldn’t try to tell ’em.”</p>

<p>“What <i>can</i> I do?” cried Davie in despair.
The flush died off, leaving his cheeks quite
white, and he twisted his small hands in distress.</p>

<p>Grandma Bascom gave him a keen look,
then bobbed her cap wisely till the frill quivered.
“Now, Phronsie,” she said, “you must
take care of Davie. He’ll be sick if you
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Grandma,” exclaimed David, quite
horrified at such a turn of affairs, “I’m not
sick.” He tried to shout it into her ear, but
she kept on, “Davie will be sick ef you don’t
take care of him, Phronsie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of Davie,” said Phronsie,
wiping away the last tear on her pinafore,
“and I shall put him to bed, so that he won’t
be sick.”</p>

<p>“That’s my good little lamb,” said Grandma,
her cap-frill bobbing worse than ever.
“Now, Davie, you go an’ curl on your ma’s
bed, an’—”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” cried Davie. “Why, I’m a
big boy, and I don’t want to go to bed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[487]</span>
day-time.” He was in such distress over the
idea that his voice was very sharp, and Grandma
heard every word.</p>

<p>“You ain’t as big as the parson,” said
Grandma coolly, “an’ Mis Henderson said she
put him to bed last week right in the middle o’
th’ day.” It was a long speech for Grandma
to make, and she wheezed so at the end that
Davie forgot everything else and ran and got
her a cup of water.</p>

<p>“An’ I’m goin’ to stay here a spell, an’
Phronsie must set by th’ bed an’ watch you,”
beginning again when she got her breath, and
the cup was taken back.</p>

<p>Phronsie, feeling very important that she
was to take care of David and keep him from
being sick, now clamored for him to get on
Mamsie’s bed, and let her tuck him up. And
nothing would do but that she should take his
hand and lead him off to the bedroom.</p>

<p>Grandma chuckled to see them go. It presently
became so still in the old kitchen that she
dozed in her chair, waking up with a start.</p>

<p>“I declare ef I haven’t lost myself jest for a
minute,” she said. “Now I’ll see how them
blessed childern is gettin’ along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[488]</span>She opened the bedroom door softly and
peeped in. Davie, with the patchwork quilt
drawn up to his chin just as Phronsie had
tucked him in, and with one arm thrown over
his head, was sleeping as he hadn’t been able to
do since Polly went away. And Phronsie,
curled up on the floor, her yellow head on the
old braided rug, was dreaming that she was
watching Davie and keeping him from getting
sick.</p>

<p>Ben and Joel found them so, when they
came home from Deacon Blodgett’s where they
had been piling wood. Joel rushed past
Grandma Bascom like a whirlwind. “<i>Sh!</i>”
she said, raising her hand. Too late! Into
the bedroom flew Joel waving something over
his head. “<i>Hoh!</i> in bed!” he cried. “Get
up, Dave!”</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Ben, “you almost
stepped on Phronsie!” and he picked her up,
as Joel jumped on the bed.</p>

<p>“It’s for you,” he cried, shaking the arm
thrown over Davie’s head. Then the old
patchwork quilt was twitched down, and something
white was thrust in its place.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Davie, his blue eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[489]</span>
dewy with sleep, and he rolled over to show
very pink cheeks.</p>

<p>“A letter from Polly,” cried Joel, waving it
impatiently.</p>

<p>Davie flew up to sit in the middle of the
bed. “<i>Oh!</i>” he cried hungrily, “a letter from
Polly!”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, and it’s for you,” screamed
Joel, sticking it into his hand.</p>

<p>Davie threw off the patchwork quilt and,
tumbling off the bed, ran out into the kitchen.
“A letter from Polly—and it’s for me!” he
shouted.</p>

<p>Just then the door opened and Mother Pepper
came in to meet Ben coming out from the
bedroom with Phronsie on his shoulder. She
kept saying, “I watched Davie all the while—I
did.”</p>

<p>It took Davie so long to open the letter with
trembling fingers, that Joel impatiently kept
crying, “Do hurry, Dave!” beating on the
table for emphasis.</p>

<p>“Hush, Joe,” cried Ben, “we couldn’t hear
the letter if it were open, you make such a
noise.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stop when he opens it,” said Joel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[490]</span>
“Oh, do hurry, Dave!” and he ran across the
kitchen with Mamsie’s big bread-knife. But
Davie already had the letter out of its envelope,
and spread in his hand.</p>

<p>They all held their breath to catch every
word, and Grandma Bascom put her hand behind
her best ear, and Davie began:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Dear Davie</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>“I just wish I could hop into the little brown
house and—(O dear me! I wrote that
crooked) see you all. To-morrow I’m going
to write to Joel.”</p>
</div>

<p>“<i>Hooray!</i>” screamed Joel. He rushed up
to Grandma and shouted in her ear, “Polly’s
going to write to me to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Come back,” cried Ben, “if you want to
hear the rest. Go on, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Wait for me,” roared Joel, skipping back.
“Have you read any more, Dave?” he cried
anxiously.</p>

<p>“No,” said Davie, “I haven’t read a bit
more.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE opening chapters introduce us to
old Boston in England. Margaret
Sidney went there in 1907 and absorbed
the atmosphere of Cotton Mather’s “St
Botolph’s Town,” gathering for herself
facts and traditions. Then “St. Botolph’s
Town” yields its scenic effects, and the
setting of the story is changed to Boston
Town of New England.</p>

<p>The story is absorbing, graphic, and
truly delightful, carrying one along till it
seems as if actual participation in the
events had been the lot of the reader. The same naturalness
that is so conspicuous in her famous “Pepper Books” marks
this latest story of Margaret Sidney’s. She makes characters
live and speak for themselves.</p>

<p>It is an inspiring, patriotic story for the young, and contains striking
and realistic pictures of the times with which it deals.—<i>Sunday School
Magazine, Nashville.</i></p>

<p>The author presents a story, but she gives a veracious picture of conditions
in the town of Boston during the Revolution. Parents who are
seeking wholesome books can place this in the front rank with entire
safety.—<i>Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p>Surely Margaret Sidney deserves the gratitude of many a child, and
grown-ups, too, for that matter, in telling in so charming, yet, withal, so
simple a manner, of these early days in this country.—<i>Utica Observer.</i></p>

<p class="center">12mo.<span class="gap">Cloth.</span><span class="gap">      Illustrated.</span></p>

<p>There are few more fascinating phases of colonial history than that
which tells the wanderings and adventures of the two judges who,
because they sat in judgment over that royal criminal, Charles the
First of England, were hunted out of England into hiding in New
England, and there remained, a mystery and fugitives, in their celebrated
cave in New Haven Colony. Marcia, the heroine, is a strong
and delightful character, and the book easily takes high rank among
the most effective and absorbing stories based upon a dramatic phase
of American history.</p>

<p>A delightful revolutionary romance of life, love, and adventure in

<p>Debby Parlin, the heroine, lived in a little house on the Lexington

<span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> TUBBS</p>

<hr class="full">
<p class="ph1"><i>An amusing and sympathetic study of a New England
woman of humble station, but noble character.</i></p>

<p class="ph1">By MARGARET SIDNEY, author of the Famous “Pepper”
books, etc.</p>

<hr class="full">

<p><b>CHICAGO RECORD-HERALD says:</b></p>

<p>What can be said is, that those who have read “Mrs. Wiggs”
will purchase “Sally, Mrs. Tubbs.” The author of this pleasant
story, who is Margaret Sidney of the “Pepper” books renown,
has rightly dedicated this tale for grown-ups to “all who love
simplicity, truth, and cheerfulness.” These virtues characterize
Sally Plunkett, whose soul-devouring ambition was “to have
’Bijah Tubbs fer life.”</p>

<p>As a chapter out of human life “Sally, Mrs. Tubbs” is, perhaps,
as good as “Mrs. Wiggs.” Regarded artistically, it shows
the workmanship of a more practised hand; it has a plot, and
this plot pleasantly complicated, and thus differs from its next
of kin. We judge that Sally and her ’Bijah, who, though little,
is “sizable” enough to meet her wants, will make the acquaintance
of those who like a book that is not over-intellectualized
nor yet lacking in soundness of heart and penetrating vision
into human nature. “Sally, Mrs. Tubbs” will furnish a hearty
laugh and a quickened sensibility.</p>

<p><b>BOSTON TRANSCRIPT says:</b></p>

<p>As a brief character-sketch, “Sally, Mrs. Tubbs” deserves no
little praise for its geniality and its humor.</p>

<p><b>BOSTON HERALD says:</b></p>

<p>This short story of 180 pages is captivating from start to finish,
and the masculine reader takes off his hat, and the feminine
reader courtesies, to this matron of the tubs, with her homely
heroism and true kindness of heart.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
